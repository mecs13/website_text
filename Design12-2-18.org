Our designers have expertise in different fields, such as architecture, psychology, sound design, lighting design and physics, in order to be able to create fully controlled experiences, guiding users in VR by shaping the virtual environment in such way.

Budget
XR technologies is an investment. Defining the budget, and thinking a road map will help designers and devellopers choosing the right way and do the best compromise, to maximize the investment.

Scalability
According to the budget and the ambition of the project, we advise to create experiences that can scale overtime. First because the market is in constant evolution, and because you want user feedbacks to expend the project in the right way.

Athmosphere
You can communicate us your ideas through pictures, 3D renders, art work and other media, or we can also work from scratch and reach your expectation through an iterative process, starting with sharing released and unrealease design with you.

Comfort
We keep a cloth eye on the user confort, working carfully the movement of the world around the user and the reverse, and the translation bitwinworlds to make sure it stays smooth from the moment you open your eye in XR to the end.

Interface
We designed a internal interface, « Torus » . The interface that maximize at it highest point the VR capabilities. It is the most intuitive and founctional way to manage the world around you keeping a full immersion. This is as well the first XR Multi platform Interface scalable.

Control
Eye tracking, Voice contrôle, AI guide, haptic controlers are some technologies we highly consider while designing XR UI & UX. Basicly we want you to forget the way you control, for your focus to be exclusivly on the result of the action and improve you performance.

3D audio
We use Music, voice, sounds and resonance , in a 3D Format to guide the user. Like music in movie, it will also increase the emotions and the final immersion. Our partnership with musician and sound creator helps us ad another layer of magic over the experience.

Worlds
Objects , constructions and landscape will be either static, either moving, either interactive, that is why we will share with you the scope of the tech potential in therm of possibilities through past and curent XR production.
