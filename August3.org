- Python we can script blender 

- physics engine: model some sort of physical interaction 
 + can modify the physics so the world does not have to abide by laws of physics: light, rain, etc. 
 + movement and logic added to their models. 

- Difference between blender and game engine: model 3D volumes, give them skeleton. Port them into game enigne. This allows you to put physics on these volumes. 
 + Football player volume: this volume has x weight and it is allowed to jump y height. 
 + Blender does not have this sense of weight or colision 
 + you should not be able to go through the walls 
 + Camera should recognize where the wall is and you can't go through the wall 

PHysics engine allows you to create parameters. 

- Wall example defiens physicsl parameters of space
- phsical parameters of a moving objects 
 + gravity is taken into account 
 + as a VR programmer you say this object weights X and has Y ability (classical physics 

- physics engine to define gravity and mass, you can allow for collisions and gravitational pull 

 + momentum is also defined 
 + magnetism needs to be added to the objects 
 + gravity 

physical laws relative to electromagnetism: electricity o

relativistic mechanics: gravity

classical mechanics
 + mechanics: related to newton's laws: 1) action/reaction,
