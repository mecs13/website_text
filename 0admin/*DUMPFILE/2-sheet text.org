Introduction

Bloomaway is a unique and intuitive VR interface allowing users to seemlessly navigate locations and information. 

Navigation

	When people step into VR, they want to touch what they see. Bloomaway removes the need 
	for hand-operated controls and allows the user to use their own hands to transport through 
	time and space. 

Seamless
	By tracking the user's line of vision, we've eliminated the disorienting elements of being 				inside VR by allowing the user's line of vision to dictate when the new experience appears.

Summary

	By building a conroller-free experience that tracks to user's line of vision, we've crafted 
	a unique and fluid addition to the VR world.
