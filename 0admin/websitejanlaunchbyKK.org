 
*** Bloomawa  y

When you first step into VR you may not know what to do or where to go. This can feel similar to the way time and space and gravity are often altered inside a dream. Bloomaway is an interface that empowers users of all experience levels to move through Virtual Reality intuitively. It only works by relying on the user's attention (where they focus their eyes), intention (what they reach out to touch with their hands), and intuition (trusting that the scenes and sounds as presented within Bloomaway are clear enough for even the most inexperienced user to understand where they are and how to travel somewhere else).

**** Benefits:
Bloomaway reduces the learning curve in VR by eliminating the need for controllers, relying instead on natural touch and hand movement. Our design responds to the first instinct most people have when entering VR, the desire to touch what they see. Bloomaway is a fluid experience.

**** Navigate Locations
Since we know where a user is looking, we also know where they are not. This simple concept allows for many practical uses for the technology. Since VR experiences are so lucid, anything that abruptly appears or disappears can cause dizziness. Bloomaway solves this issue by only loading or changing elements of visual perception when they are completely out of the user's sightline. In one version of Bloomaway, the user sees a virtual map, selects their desired destination by reaching out and touching it, and is then prompted by an audio command to turn their head 180 degrees. Once they turn around they find themselves in an entirely new environment Through this feature, Bloomaway can take a user from New York to Paris at the touch of a map without the feeling of movement. Like a dream, Bloomaway seamlessly links one space to another.

**** In Business
One of the most immediate business applications for this program is within the relocation industry. When a company decides to relocate an employee to another city, it's a costly adjustment that requires as many as three visits to the new city for the employee and their family. Factors like living arrangements, transportation options, schooling for their children, and general awareness of the city's geography are all part of this acclimation process. Displaying key parts of the city to the employee in Virtual Reality reduces the number of visits (and thus transportation and accomodation costs) and greatly reduces the financial burden to the company facilitating the relocation. 

*** New Year's Eve (Right box scroll, Title, punchline)

In stereoscopic 3D Virtual Reality we bring you to 10 iconic cities around the world. All you need is the internet.

On the most exciting evening of the year, we introduce the user to our unique VR interface (Bloomaway) in the form of a customized lobby. Upon entering the lobby, the user is presented with a selection of 10 cities from across the globe. Viewing the cities on a virtual globe, they reach out and touch their preferred New Year's Eve destination, arriving there in just seconds. 

By arranging a series of 360 cameras in some of the most lively neighborhoods in the most exciting cities around the world, we live stream and and then centralize the content into a computer graphic game engine, so users can access it from any location. Once inside the New Year's experience, users have the option of linking up with friends, meeting new people, or soaking in the most energizing evening of the year however they choose. 

Visit all 10 cities or explore the nuances of just one. You decide. 

New Year's Eve is an example of the global possibilities of live event streaming in the Virtual World. 

*** On-Site Entertainment 

With the advancement of in-home entertainment, it’s been a constant challenge for exhibits and museums to draw folks away from their living rooms. Unlike the television and the computer, Virtual Reality is not yet a wide-spread in-home technology. As a result, companies are finding it advantageous to develop unique content in VR and display it at their place of businesses. When positioning VR this way, location-based entertainment companies are able to market it as a commodity, marking a point of differentiation from their competition. Once the customer arrives on-site, VR then becomes a tool that affords an entirely new means of interacting with the information. 

An industry that has benefited from this type of idea development are aquariums. 

Here’s how we’ve developed the customer flow in the past: 

**** Guest Experience 

A mother of three children notices on Instagram that the local aquarium has added an on-site Virtual Reality experience. She’s been on the lookout for a weekend activity, and decides to schedule the whole family for a visit to the aquarium next Saturday. When they arrive, the first thing her kids notice are mixed reality images showing guests swimming side-by-side with sea life. Her elementary-age kids loved pretending to scuba dive over the summer, and they're bouncing around at the thought of this virtual experience. 

She knows it'll be an education in spatial awareness and biology and create an emotional connection between her children and non-human species. Putting their name on the list that says the next opening for the VR experience is at 1:30PM, she tells the kids, "Perfect, we'll leave the cafeteria at 12:30 to give ourselves plenty of time." In the afternoon, all four of them are able to enter the VR experience together and experience the exhilaration of swimming beside humpback whales.

*** Facematch

The age-old challenge: how do you really know if your ad worked? Generally, you don’t. You have insights, clues, and stats but are missing a key metric: viewer-visit verification.

By analyzing Facebook user login info and profile photos, we'll create, encrypt, and database a library of photos, cross reference it against the photos taken of visitors when they arrive at customs, and produce a number that represents your ad's success rate.

-Year 2

We will build your Facematch software during a 16 week development process.  This includes full specification, production, and implementation. At the end of 16 weeks we'll be prepared to launch the first iteration of the software. The program will continue improving as we continue compiling data.
				
-Year 3

Using results obtained in 2018, you'll now be able to grow your application and enlarge your Face Matching database to gather more pertinent analytics. This could include integrating biometric software across other media content, increasing user base, and, allowing you to better-target the right audience and increase heads in beds.

** Services
One of the first indications that a budding industry has become emerging is when service providers begin facilitating the technology. Here's how we help you get up to speed with XR. 

*** Consultation

XR allows us to connect, share and engage more viscerally than ever before. Humans have been systematically communicating since persian curries and greek rail systems in the 6th century BCE). For several hundred years, there was little advancement in horse speed or volume, but upon the discovery and understanding of electricity, we had an avalanche of advancements in communication.   

Beginning with the telegram and then the telephone, we shorted communication over long distance to an explosive extent.  What took months could be done in minutes. As we further adapted communication tools, we improved the quality, and volume, forging industries like radio and tv to communicate on a mass sale.  these mediums we capitalized and content became controlled by governments and money.  

As hardware advanced, we learned to communicate directly on private networks of universities (arpanet), businesses (another example) and then linking everyone into one web with single protocol and a simple set of rules, with the world wide web, in 1990. This gave communication a far further reaching infrastructure for all media. Today, we've a new form of content, as digital information has evolved from audio, to moving images, and now into replicated environments, with CXR.
   

**** XR Training

We express the language of these technologies to you in simple terms so you can gain virtual independence. We train your employees to understand, operate, and troubleshoot in XR - all critical elements to succeeding with advanced equipment. Periodically, we'll deliver presentations and supporting documents to facilitate your education. 

Ultimately, our aim is to integrate VR into your existing systems to better assist your clients.

**** Evolving Media

Immersive technologies are revolutionizing how we engage with the world. Today, VR is poised to forever change the way we communicate, interact, and live.  

Throughout history, new media-technologies have disrupted markets and catalyzed economic growth.  We adopt such innovations at an accelerated rate. We expect twenty-five percent of the US population to have AR/VR in their homes within the next 24 months.

*** AR, VR, & MR
An early question often asks about the difference among them. 

AR: Allows the user to view their surroundings through a smart screen and see superimposed digital information that enhances their visual experience of the physical world. 

VR: Is a completely immersive and digitally enhanced world. 

MR: Merges the real and virtual worlds to produce an environment in which physical and digital objects coexist. 

ar-vs-vr-venn-diagram-21.png

*** Source Development 

We scout top talent from around the world. Our team has access in more than 50 countries.

We often hire third-party developers dependent on tasks, timing and budgets. Our most trusted developers have a considerable amount of input on the experience’s design and content. 

The business arrangement between the developer is governed by a contract, which specifies a list of milestones intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones we verify that work is progressing quickly enough to meet deadlines.  We work closely to direct the developers if the experience is falling short of expectations. Nova guarantees its work.   

*** VR Installation
Often the best XR solution includes installing and displaying the technology at your work space. In these cases, we handle the delivery, installation, and setup to care for your needs. 

*** Education

***** Situated Learning* 

Situated learning is a theory on how individuals acquire professional skills, extending research on apprenticeship into how legitimate peripheral participation leads to membership in a community of practice. Situated learning "takes as its focus the relationship between learning and the social situation in which it occurs".
The perspective can be contrasted with alternative views of learning: "Rather than defining [learning] as the acquisition of propositional knowledge, Lave and Wenger situated learning in certain forms of social co-participation. Rather than asking what kinds of cognitive processes and conceptual structures are involved, they ask what kinds of social engagements provide the proper context for learning to take place".

***** Embodied Cognition 

The theory that many features of cognition, whether human or otherwise, are shaped by aspects of the entire body of the organism.  The features of cognition include high level mental constructs (such as concepts and categories) and performance on various cognitive tasks (such as reasoning or judgement).   The aspects of the body include the moto system, the perceptual system, bodily interactions with the environment (situatedness) and the assumptions about the world that are built into the structure of the organism. 

*** Resource Center
Through academic relationships and our own study of the industry and its history, we'll periodically deliver presentations and supporting documents to assist your understanding of XR and better assist your clients. For example, Dale's Cone of Learning was an innovative study in the mid 20th century supporting the notion that within two weeks humans retain 90% of what they do and say - a breakthrough realization compared to the 50% retention of what we see and hear. Credible studies like this one are proving applicable again as the immersive XR worlds continue to grow.

*** VR Marketing 

As immersive content alters today's media landscape, marketing strategies are evolving into Virtual Reality. The first step to joining this movement is building 3D models of your content, so it can be displayed in the Virtual Space. Once this is done, we'll work with you to devise the best route for communicating your brand through this new media. Similarly to the way marketing strategies shifted at the end of last decade with the social media boom, we're now entering an even more immersive form of visual communication. Behind the initial learning curve is an incredible means of connecting with your customers. 

Below is an example of what's been an effective transition process for several of our clients.  

**** Progression: 

- Transform current 3D models into VR through games and narratives.
- Demo VR experience in a controlled room with customized microtexture.
- Engage with ultrasonic for haptics, 3D studio, and wireless 6DoF headset.
- Monitor user's cognitive state with biometric software.
- Remind buyers about the key features and benefits of your product. 

**** Development

Month 1-2: Design marketing objective functionality and storyline UI/UX.
Deliverables: Full spec, demo, studio options.

Month 3-7: Development & Testing: Outfit for 3D acoustics and ultrasonics.
Deliverables: Beta version of VR experience & hardware.

Month 8-10 Refine + Prepare: Improve application, rebuild microarchitecture, media
roll out, PR outreach.
Deliverables: Final VR experience, media coverage, and launch party.

Month 11-20: Distribution & measuring Success: Deploy media, owned/paid/ earned. Measure success on key performance indicators identified in “Design” or through customized biometric software that gauges attention, emotion, and cognitive load.
Deliverable: Publication, media reports.

*** Reduce Internal Costs
Once you become fluent in Extended Reality, it'll shore up loose ends within your operations structure - automating some forms of internal training and offering a higher caliber solution to video chats and messenger platforms. 

** Production
As soon as we formalize partnership the delivery process begins. Generally this is how things progress:

*** Design 
After understanding why an extension into this technology is the right solution for your business, we'll deliver a design concept rooted in the values of your brand. It'll be the first layer of your developing three-dimensional solution. 

*** Develop
Once the visuals have been established, we'll integrate them through an industry-leading 3D coding engine (Unity and Unreal are among the top programs), and develop the best experience for your needs.

**** Game Engine

The core functions are typically rendering 3D graphics, a physics engine collision detection and collision response systems, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, and scene graph.  Your engine may also include video support for cinematics, 3D audio for sonic immersion, biometric software to read physiological reactions, or artificial intelligence algorithms to better index user data.

[4 images available web-text --> pages --> 1solutions --> 2services --> 2production --> Develop --> Game Engine ]

We economize the process of game development by reusing/adapting the same game engine to create different games.  This also makes it easier to port games to multiple platforms.

*** Test
Once the experience has been designed and developed, we'll deploy it to professional testing studios that will apply pressure to the program and report weaknesses, so we can solidify it through an iterative process. 

** Publishing
When acquiring XR for marketing purposes, we'll guide you to the proper portion of the market. With a few slight advancements, XR is best marketed under similar principles that have driven the digital marketing industry. 

*** Distribution
Depending on the XR solution that fits your mission, there are several ways in which your content can reach customers. One option is to arrange the hardware at your place of work and add XR to your in-house flow. A more expansive distribution form comes with publishing the content on a major VR app store - Oculus and Steam are two high-traffic destinations. Another option is to arrange your XR hardware and original content at remote locations, reaching folks while they're out in the physical world. This is similar channel distribution through a more immersive media.

Our recommendation is to approach distribution similar to the approach of any other content you might create.  The key is still simply putting the correct message in front of the correct audience with effective frequency.  10 million people in the US use VR.   As early adopters, they will influence 50%+ of the market.

*** Activation
Social media maintains a significant amount of attention at a rate below market value. Buying attention through social is still the route to travel along with native advertisements, that's your paid media. You still want to own social media handles and SEO keywords. The earned media comes more naturally with emerging technologies, as media outlets are eager to inform their readership about what's rising and who's rising with it. 

*** Data Review
With this hardware being affixed to the human body and with sensors just millimeters from the eyeballs, VR provides an opportunity to record and measure the sensory experience that occurs while customers are experiencing your content. Some of this data collection is referred to as biometric tracking. Factors like motivation, cognitive workload, emotional stress, tension, and eye movement are integrated into data reviews.

** Publications
We read, study, build relationships, and devise solutions. It's our work. Along the way we document our findings and provide them to you behind password-protected publications.

*** Financial Strategies
Upon receiving an assignment, our innovation lab dives into a research period, understanding and then communicating to you the most efficient path toward financial gain. These studies are customized to fit your company.

At the start of the year we developed a Financial Strategy for Pandora's VR experience: 

**** Abstract
A financial strategy is proposed to Pandora leveraging short term marketing and stable long term revenue.

- N.B. None of the sources are optimal for the moment, just some ideas of what we can back up*

**** General idea
Build a music VR platform. Research has shown that VR has potentially disturbing implications for the music industry:
- http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38795190
- https://www.marketingweek.com/2016/06/09/consumers-are-most-drawn-to-travel-and-music-experiences-on-virtual-reality/
- https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2017/07/live-concerts-take-virtual-virtual-reality/
- https://www.forbes.com/sites/cheriehu/2016/04/23/virtual-reality-in-the-music-industry-needs-to-be-a-tool-not-just-an-experience/#330a56df6147

Pandora innovated with the web and data analytic in the past decade. But these innovation are slowly being reproduced by competitors. By leveraging VR, pandora can leapfrog their competitors by innovating once more.

**** Long term strategy (3 year)
***** TB quantify all of this
Create a VR based music platform. It should be easy to add features to this platform as to meet a wider range of user demand. 

Once the user count is large enough (>100k users), it becomes easy to add paid for features to the platform (freemium model) or even generate revenue from dynamics ads (product placement, billboards, etc).

***** Budget
500k-1M:
- 100k-200k per app that is added to the platform at a rate of 1 or 2 per year

***** Break even analysis
****** User growth
Variety.com says that in Q2 2016, Pandora had 400,000 premium users paying 10 usd/month. Yearly, this comes up to (400k * 10 * 12) = 48M usd. Statista.com says that by January 2017, Pandora had 81M active users on its platform. This means that by 2017, Pandora was averaging just under 0.6 usd per user per year.

Venturebeat says that by October 2016, 6% of Americans owned a VR headset. Assuming that the distribution of Pandora users is the same as the distribution of Americans, then about (81*0.06=) 4.86M Pandora users own a VR headset. In truth, this is conservative because Pandora users tend to be more tech savvy than the average American and therefore more likely to have a VR headset (i.e: we can assume that more than 6% of Pandora user have a VR headset.

- N.B. This population of Pandora users owning a VR headset is directly marketable from the pandora.com website.*

Assuming the starting user base of the VR platform is 1% (an arbitrarily small percentage) of the 6% of Pandora users that have headsets, this comes down to about *50k users*.

Before making the growth prediction for this VR project, let us analyze the growth pandora.com has had between 2001 and 2016. We will use a viral model (dy/dt = ky) to model the growth between these dates. We will then apply this growth to the VR app with a starting user base of 50k users (calculated above).

- 2001:
  + 1 user (viral models need to start with at least 1 user)
- 2016
  + 81M users (source: statista.com)

The growth model for pandora.com between 2001 and 2016 is: y(t) = exp(1.3 * t). 1.3 being what is called the /growth constant/, y is the /user base at year t/.

We can now use this growth constant and apply it to a viral model with initial user base of 50k: y(t) = 50,000 * exp(1.3 * t):
- y(1) = 180k users
- y(2) = 673k users
- y(3) = 2.5M users

****** Revenue projections
Applying the current revenue per user per year of pandora.com, about 0.6 usd (calculated above), we:

**** Short term strategy (1 year)
***** TB quantify all of this (in process, see: [[../../research/vr-press-coverage.org][vr market analysis)]]
To compensate for the initial investment required to leverage VR's potential, one can leverage the free marketing that will be provided by journalist and bloggers writing about this new music platform. Indeed, when corporations implement VR, people talk about it generating free marketing:
- https://www.forbes.com/sites/leoking/2014/05/03/ford-where-virtual-reality-is-already-manufacturing-reality/#4930fe1d6e4d

- https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/3/16408448/toys-r-us-ar-app-play-chaser

****** TB show that free marketing will pay for this first phase of the project
In order to leverage this marketing with minimum costs, the project should start by implementing a 'fun' Pandora VR frontend. This allows for a cheap app to test the market, that is easy to add features on to. 
If the feedback (user count and news articles) is promising, it becomes easy to add features to this platform and bootstrap into the 'long term strategy' discussed above.

 
**** Risk analysis

***** journalists and blogger don't talk about it.
That's unlikely for the reasons stated above

***** platform doesn't pick up
We're 'derisking' this by having a modular project. Allowing us to move on at a pace where we can test the market response. This will allow us to abort the project with minimum investment if needed.

*** Market Research 
In the same vein we study the ways in which your company fits the current market climate - detailing the state of the market along with reflections and forecasts surrounding it. 

At the start of 2018 we developed a market research report for an optometrist in New York City. 

**** Understanding the Market

Greenlight Insights - among the top resources for Virtual Reality market maps, forecasts, and consumer insights - tells us that VR is a $7 billion industry in 2017. A couple of industry-leading hardware giants - Facebook and HTC Vive - brought this movement to the forefront by releasing new VR headsets in 2016. As expected, the price point of installing this young technology in the home is out of reach for most consumers. Instead, most patients will first experience this technology when they walk into your office.

Now that the hardware has established itself in the market, consumers are becoming more literate with VR and will be prepared to use it at home when the price point comes down. As this process unfolds, forecasts anticipate that VR will become a $75 billion industry by 2021. The future of Dr. Kelly's first-of-its kind content could extend beyond his office and into the hands of millions of Americans at home.

*** Lab Live
We draw more distant connections to a wide range of thought processes by relating to a wide range of people, concepts, and industries.

**** The Future of Storytelling
As I’ve been diving into the Virtual Reality world over the last six weeks, I’ve got to be honest…I haven’t know what's been going on in most conversations. Talks of biometrics and haptics and HTC Vive vs. Oculus and whether the artwork was created in Tiltbrush have sent me to YouTube to get caught up on industry basics.

Then, on Saturday morning I took a ride to a VR event on Staten Island — The Future of Storytelling. It resembles an art festival. Exhibits are set up outdoors and in their designated tents. There’s far more than VR available at FoST — there’s sound-based meditation, 360º video, live poetry, group experiments, silent theatrical performances, and live panel discussions. On top of that, there’s an ice cream truck from Brooklyn, juicers, Mexican food, and fresh fruit for sale.

The event is set up on the grounds of Snug Harbor Cultural Center, a sprawling local garden on the north end of Staten Island. It was 80 degrees on the first Saturday in October and an estimated 3,000 techies showed up.

In this writing, I’m going to confront what I’ve identified as a gap in the VR world — the ability to communicate its intricacies in layman’s terms.

***** Virtual Reality

VR is an emerging industry driven by people with elevated computer (or “machine”) literacy. By proxy, this is not an industry wrought with individuals who are expert in communicating this machine knowledge to the mainstream.

This, along with the high cost of the equipment, may to be one of the early reasons why extended reality has remained an underground movement. The mainstream is either unaware of this new media or hasn’t been able to understand it. On top of that, it’s difficult to describe with words these immersive experiences, which are completely separate from all forms of entertainment that have come before them.

**** How It Works

A user experiences Virtual Reality by putting on what’s referred to as a headmount. There are two major brands — HTC Vive (created by a Taiwanese software company and made available by an American digital distributor) and Oculus (purchased by Facebook in 2012). The headmount resembles ski goggles — with the front of the goggles featuring a mobile-phone-sized screen enclosed within. Once you’re eyes are inside the device and the experience begins, you’re now existing in a digital world. You look all around you, up and down, and use a set of controls to create the sensation that you’re physically moving through this virtual world.

***** What It Looks Like Inside

There are two types of VR visuals: 1) Interactive (these graphics appear similarly to video game graphics) and 2) 360º video (this content has been captured with a 360º camera and resembles the images you’d see on a TV screen or in a film). At The Future of StoryTelling, there were just as many experiences rooted in one form as the other.

***** Physiological Reaction

VR can cause the human mind to feel as though it’s falling off a ledge, driving on the highway, or flying above the desert. It challenges the laws of gravity and the passage of time and the perception of what’s happening to your body. The results can be equally as exhilarating as dizzying.

This is an element of the VR experience that can’t really be explained. How many of us know what it feels like to fly through outer space while looking down on the rotating earth? So the brain draws on what it has already experienced and tries to communicate to the body the physiological reactions that accompany these experiences.

***** Filming and Gaming

Just like was the case with the printing press, radio, television, and the internet, people are still learning how to create content for Virtual Reality. The natural tendency is to create what we know. For instance, the most common types of VR content right now are heavily related to one of two forms of entertainment: 1) Film or 2) Gaming. This is what we know to create.

This is a great place to start and it’s inspirational to witness people exploring the potential of VR. However, VR is not meant to be a new host for film nor gaming. Much of the content I saw at FoST was content that could have been communicated at the movie theatre or on a gaming device.

The content that does seem exclusive to VR seems also to be stuck in the “so what” phase. For instance, one of the most VR-specific experiences at FoST was called Preoration. Once you put on the goggles, you were taken into a desert where a 6-piece band was performing — they were the only six people visible for miles and miles. After spending a minute or two watching and listening to the band perform, a desert sandstorm began materializing in the distance. I could feel the wind on the back of my neck (from fans set up in the tent by the creators of the experience) and felt the nervousness of being caught in this storm. Then the sandstorm surrounded me and the performing band until I was eventually elevated above them. It felt as though I were in a hot air balloon as I rose and rose above the others. After a few more seconds I entered into a UFO and the image faded to darkness.

While I felt gratitude and admiration for the content creator’s ability to express through VR, I did not leave the experience with a clear sense of the medium’s purpose. Often when I interact with a piece of content I ask myself — what was the creator’s intent? What were they trying to communicate? Do I have the desire to come back?

***** The Breakthrough Is Coming

There is no doubt the breakthrough is coming. The technology is too advanced and the experience is too immersive and physiological for this not to be the next step in media. It’s also too similar to what humans have been seeking for centuries: the ability to control time and gravity. VR is the 21st century’s best attempt at time travel and teleportation.

**** Crossing The Chasm

This is an introduction to Nova Media’s two-part examination of Virtual Reality’s journey toward critical mass in the consumer market.

VR has a long and fragmented history dating all the way back to Morton Heilig in the 1950s. Then there was a simulation of Aspen, Colorado that came out of MIT in the late 70’s. A decade and a half later Sega announced the release of their first VR headset for an arcade game.

All of these…just a few of the breakthroughs that have led to predictions about how and when VR will make its significant impact on the consumer market.

But as the years passed we heard just a faint noise from this new virtual world playing in the background, often drowned out by HD TVs, smartphones, and social media.

The noise got louder, though, in 2014 when Facebook acquired Oculus and it’s new VR headset for over $2 billion. And then — at Oculus’ annual conference last month — a louder noise from Mark Zuckerberg, who said, “I am more committed than ever to the future of VR.”

So now, three years into Facebook’s involvement with this emerging technology, we’re still asking the question: when will VR reach critical mass?

In 1989 Geoffrey Moore wrote the first version of “Crossing The Chasm”, studying why, how, and at what rate new ideas and technologies spread through the market.

His book, which emerged in its third version three years ago, studies the tendencies with which young technologies progress through the adoption life cycle. The writing focuses on how these products often wind up stuck in the divide between the early adopters and the early majority. This can be a deadly place for a new technology to try and survive, as the early majority makes up 1/3 of the market.

This series will examine where VR stands in relation to this curve, what’s prevented it from breaking through, and what will need to happen in order for it to cross the next divide.

**** Off The Ground

This Is The 2nd in a Nova XR Media's two-part series.

As we study the way a new technology progresses through the Adoption Lifecycle, we realize the innovators have already captured Virtual Reality.

Geoffrey Moore describes the innovators as a group of technology enthusiasts who appreciate the tech for its own sake. They don’t need to believe it will break through in the market nor that it holds the potential for greater achievement. The innovators savor in the technology for everything it is — whether it’s the smooth texture of the software or it’s painfully slow operating speed.

With Facebook having committed a multi-billion-dollar investment and MIT using Facebook’s new VR headset to allow humans first person control of robots, the innovators have their hands on Virtual Reality.

The early adopters come in behind the innovators and bring their vision. Moore calls them, “That rare breed of people who have the insight to match up an emerging technology to a strategic opportunity, the temper to translate that insight into a high-visibility, high-risk project, and the charisma to get the rest of their organization to buy into that project…the core of their dream is a business goal, not a technology goal.”

Well, as we approach 2018, VR has extended its reach all the way to Lowe’s, who’s incorporated a Holoroom to allow customers immersive experiences such as shifting the paint color on the walls of their new room. This means homeowners who may work in any range of industries have experienced VR inside a building operated by one of the strongest brands in the country.

While reaching this level of audience is an advanced step for the technology, it’s an indication of Lowe’s reaching right to left across the chasm and becoming an early adopter.

We see evidence of this with CNBC’s report that estimates Facebook sold fewer than 400,000 units of their Oculus Rift in 2016. Remember, the early majority represents one third of the market, so if the largest tech giant didn’t break ½ million sales in its first year, we understand that VR has yet to cross over.

**** The Father of VR

[[file:https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxo0acsvprqh0ti/Morton%20Heilig%20Photo.jpg?dl=0]]

There were a few middle-aged guys over the studio last month and I referred to VR as a “new technology.” One of them seemed ready to catch me on this and drop a mention of how VR has been around for decades and how our studio should know all about this — being that we produce it and all.

“A new technology?” he asked suspiciously.

“Well,” I said. “If you really wanted to you could go all the way back to Morton Heilig in the 1950s and begin the story of VR back then.”

Mentioning that name was, in itself, enough to prevent any further suspicion. But if the gentleman had asked me to speak any more about Heilig I wouldn’t have been able to.

I remembered that an old guy on the back patio of the coffee shop in Red Hook had labeled him as “The Father of VR” back in the fall, but beyond that I didn’t know much more.

So, I spent last night reading about him and what he brought to an industry that is, more than half a century later, still budding.

Born in 1926, Heilig established himself as a cinematographer, using that background to eventually develop and patent two pieces of technology: “the telesphere mask” and the “Sensorama.” He and his partner began the development of these machines in 1957, patenting them in 1962.

A bulky piece of technology shaped like an old-school arcade game, the sensorama allowed the user to sit on a chair and lean their head into the equipment — kinda like you would the vision machine at the optometrist. One of the first experiences available in the Sensorama was of a motorcycle ride through Brooklyn. Heilig attempted to incorporate all the senses and draw the viewer into a cinematic experience — a very similar description of what we understand VR to be more than 60 years later. He referred to it as “Experience Theatre.”

He published a paper in 1955 called the “The cinema of the future” in which he detailed a multi-sensory theatre experience. The first text that appears inside the document reads, “Thus, individually and collectively, by thoroughly applying the methodology of art, the cinema of the future will become the first art form to reveal the new scientific world to man in the full sensual vividness and dynamic vitality of his consciousness.”

After this writing he went on to create the sensorama and five short film displays. The machine still functions to this day.

Eventually, Heilig said he wasn’t able to capture high enough quality images from 35mm film cameras in order to create an immersive experience that was marketable enough to the general public.

Here’s the link to his 1955 research paper. https://gametechdms.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/w6_thecinemaoffuture_morton.pdf

** Productions

*** Past Productions

**** Cayman 
**** Hardrock
**** Kelly Vision
**** Taiwan

***** Situation: 
Taiwan is of the lesser-known Asia destinations with an amazing culture to share.  We needed to stand apart from the rest of Asia. Knowing we will not brand bigger than China or Japan in the short-term, we complimented them.

***** Strategy: 
- Introduce  a credible message about the culture, food, and beauty of the destination.
- Communicate the trust and credibility of a known personality to highlight “Why Taiwan”.
- Share from a 1st person perspective.
- Develop PR exposure through creative engagement

***** Production:  
- Travel expert, Pauline Frommer brought the travel show to Taiwan. We created an array of content to share across multiple distribution channels. 
- Integrate with entertainment darlings and showcase the culture through event partnerships in Bryant Park.   

***** Results:  
- 7% increase in US visits year over year.  
- Renewed production program at a 45% increase in investment.   
- 12% over-delivery of media commercials.  
- 10 million media impressions through “earned media”.  
- Evergreen content to repurpose indefinitely. 

*** Learning 

**** How 
Humans retain information best when we are actively involved, as we learn with our entire body.   Similar to “muscle memory,” XR content enables embodied cognition, so people can see, hear and touch objects in simulated situations, enabling more comprehensive understanding.   

**** What
Anything you might learn from a video, you’ll soon more effectively learn in XR. Consider for a moment training videos, tutorials, and learning modules. Now consider being able to interact with those information forms in XR. This technology takes you from behind the desk and places you in an interactive space.  Research sites, production plants, classrooms, space shuttles (and any other physical locations in which spatial learning is crucial) can be replicated and programmed for customized learning.   

**** Who
As with most technologies, the military and science centers have been for decades developing these tools to better place people in simulated situations.  Now, major brands and education institutions are further bringing XR into the hands of their employees and empowering entire teams of every-day folks to learn more, faster.  May it be to practice a dangerous feat, to collaborate on research, or to familiarize new employees, XR is being adopted across the board.
