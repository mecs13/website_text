* Solutions

** Products
We desgin products for businesses and artists.  We develop visual tools that simplify xr technology into intuitive design.  These interfaces, softwares and events are fundamental solutions for developing content, producing experiences and building virtual worlds.


*** Torus (Right box scroll, Title, punchline)
    We have established a smooth and intuitive way for the user to interface with Virtual Reality. The Torus is the means of processing information flow in the new world, making interaction with VR a seamless experience for anyone who enters. This product design is inspired by the way humans, plants, and animals process information in the physical world.      

*** XR Color (Right box scroll, Title, punchline)
For more than 100 years we've known that color can be divided by hue, lightness, and saturation. With the understanding of these parameters we're introducing in VR an object that embodies the entire spectrum, immersing us in a world of color. We find this most applicable among people designing and developing within 3D game engines. It's been effective as an educational tool for artists, and as we learn more about color therapy, we're beginning to understand this product as a means of practicing wellness. 

*** Architecture
Before architects bring their work into the physical world, it's first expressed on a blueprint and 2D screen. Virtual Reality is the intermediate step between a two dimensional plan and the act of building these innovative structures in our towns and cities. In VR, architects draw, measure, and construct buildings in an immersive space in order to introduce a more refined product to the physical world.

*** Music Experience (Right box scroll, Title, punchline)
Music is a dynamic form of communication that's established a prominent position among the world's most expensive media forms. Music plays a crucial role in Extended Reality, as XR opens an additional dimension between music and media, allowing users to share music in three dimensional environments, mix and create music, and even unite with favorite bands or artists without leaving home.

*** Infinite Gallery (Right box scroll, Title, punchline)

*** Bloomaway (Right boxscroll, Title, punchline)
When you first step into VR you may not know what to do or where to go. This can feel similar to the way time and space and gravity often emerge differently inside a dream. Bloomaway is an interface empowering users of all experience levels to move through Virtual Reality intuitively. It only works by relying on the user's attention (where they focus their eyes), intention (what they reach out to touch with their hands), and intuition (trusting that the scenes and sounds as presented within Bloomaway are clear enough for even the most inexpe
rienced user to understand where they are and how to arrive somewhere else). Bloomaway is also the solution to an early problem with some VR technology that causes the user dizziness. Through a concept called Dreamscaping, we've implemented the most efficient way to eliminate dizziness. With this piece of innovation, a virtual shift in location takes place outside the user's field of vision.

***** Dev intro

/Games/, for the purposes of designing xr in a "game engine", can be understood as follows:  /A competition in which players' skill, chance and/or endurance is deployed with strategy to achieve a goal, in accordance with a set of rules.  Winners write the history/ 



***** Game Engine

Source Engine and indie-darling Unity3D are examples of great tools built by people 

tools to make games bigger and better





:Game Engine picture







- unity
- unreal engine


A *game engine* is a software framework used to create interactive 3D media (XR).  We build XR in game engines.  

Game engines equip us to custom design virtual environments, program rules and netowrk experiences to be shared on personal computers, mobile dvices and gaming consules. Game engine framework's core functions are to render 3D graphics, engineer physics/collision (and response systems) manage memoreym shread, and graph scenes.   

We economize the process of game development by reusing/adaptig the same game engine to create different games.  This also makes it easier to port games to multiple platforms.



The core functions are typically rendering 3D graphics, a physics engine orcollision detection and collision response systems, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, and scene graph.  Your engine may also include video support for cinematics, 3D audio for sonic immersion, biometric software to read physicological reactions, or artificial intelligent algorthms to better index user data.
****** Unreal Engine 
A game engine developed by Epic Games, first showcased in the 1998, stelath first person shooter, MMORPGs, RPGs, 
- Code written in C++
- Features a high degree of portability 
- A tool used by many game developers today.

***** 3D Modeling
Objects and environemtns we create in 3D modeling software, maya, blender, rhino.   

@JACQUES please say something HERE. ^^^^^

In 3D computer graphics, 3D modeling (or three-dimensional modeling) is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any three-dimensional surface of an object (either inanimate or living) via specialized software. The product is called a 3D model. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena. The model can also be physically created using 3D printing devices.
 
***** Animation
- You are inside the animation
- think: walking through 100 acre woods with winnie the pooh
- animationed avatars to engage
- define "rigging"  What in VR is rigged?  WHy is it rigged?

***** Finite State Machines:
finite state machines are mafe of ecplicite states,.    they each have their own comands and logic per frame, as well as upon entering or leaving a state.  States have rules tha indicate when they can transition and how.  For example "observing", "exploring" and "engaging" states of an AI bot in a VR experience.   In the engaging state the bot might be reacting more direectly to your movements and voice cues, while in "exploring" it is concerned with the surroundings and where it's string of attention goes.  If the bot has AI, and learns over time, it will develeop its own prefrences based on however it is programed to.  For exmple..

A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. A FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition.

***** Artificial intelligence
****** AI Assistance
For example, to command our AI assistant, "Take me to Buenos Airesd"  The machine simply needs to know to teleport to that 360 video content.   DzBring me to wherever Kelly is"  or "Tell my wife I am going to be thirty minutes late"  The system needs to be smart enough not only to understand the intent, but also to know who the wife is and the best way to contact her. No extraneous information is necessary, no option list, no follow-up questions. We call this Minimum Viable Interaction (MVI).

We will talk with the concierge — not with commands, menus and quirky key combinations —but using our own human language.   This is Natural Language Processing, a foremost technique for human-to-machine discussions.   

*Contextual awareness* allows the machine to compare the query to known information, such as location, recent searches, and recent conversation with contacts.  Using sensors on their phones, watches or whatever other device they connect to our experience we can post to social and read available they give us permission to

The system needs to know more about us for invisible UI to become reality. Contextual awareness today is somewhat limited. For example, when asking for directions via Google Maps, the system knows your location and will return a different result if you are in New York versus California. Our phones, watches and other mobile devices are loaded with a ton of sensors. They make us humans the cheap sensors machines need today. We gather the knowledge and data that the system needs to do its work

****** Index Data
artificial intelligent algorthms to better index user data.
****** Characters:     
Imagine a virtual character with behaviors that were Dzsmartdz as in it learned from past mistakes.   You already know this from referral automation on the web especially within services you tow which subscribe.

 In virtual reality, these DzAI Charactersdz will improve their suggestions and improvisation with generative design.  These will be non-player characters (NPCs) but simulating human behavior and thought the best it can.   As Turing tested, If you cannot distinguish the difference between another player and a NPC, what’s the difference?    

The most obvious example is a personalized host like Siri, Alexis, or Cortana.    In virtual reality, they will represent beyond their voice, with a physical body.   You can of course customize your virtual companion not just by appearance but by personality, attitude, relationship and onward.   With vast personalization settings available for the user to adjust we give control to the user instead of guessing what they want.  we can adjust the algorithms to our own preference, and then they learn on their own.    
****** Generative Design  
****** Personalizations
Unity is a cross-platformgame engine developed Unity Technologis a  consoles mobile devicean websites First announced only for  OS X, at Apple's  Worldwide Developers Conference  in 2005, it has since been extended to target 21 platforms. Nintendo provides free licenses of Unity 5 to all licensed Nintendo Developers along with their software development kit s (SDKs) for the  Wii U and Nintendo 3DS Family

****** Self Learning 
AIs will teach itself to interact with avatars by practicing on the hundreds of avatars.   Everyone’s funded participation goes to the build of a single AI who’s job is to interact with real people.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving" (known as Machine Learning).[As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For instance, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an example of "artificial intelligence", having become a routine technology.Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go, self-driving cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and interpreting complex data.

***** Phsycis Engine
***** Sourcing Development 
We often hire third-party developers dependent on tasks, timing and budgets.   Are most trusted developers have a considerable amount of input on the expereiences design and content. 

The business arrangement between the developer is governed by a contract, which specifies a list of milestones intended to be delivered over a period of time. By updating its milestones, the we verify work is progressing quickly enough to meet deadlines.  We work closely to direct the developers if the experience is falling short of expectations, because Nova guarentees its work.   


***** Physics Engine*
A physics engine is computer software that provides an approximate simulation of certain physical systems, such as rigid body dynamics (including collision detection), soft body dynamics, and fluid dynamics, of use in the domains of computer graphics, video games and film.

***** Motion Capture*
(Mo-cap for short) is the process of recording the movement of objects or people. It is used in military, entertainment, sports, medical applications, and for validation of computer vision[2] and robotics. In filmmaking and video game development, it refers to recording actions of human actors, and using that information to animate digital character models in 2D or 3D computer animation.

***** Cloud Computing*
Cloud computing is a type of Internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in either privately owned, or third-party data centersBthat may be located far from the user–ranging in distance from across a city to across the world. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over an electricity network.

***** Blockchain*

A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data — once recorded, the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively. Through the use of a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server, a blockchain database is managed autonomously. Blockchains are "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. The ledger itself can also be programmed to trigger transactions automatically

***** Cryptocurrency*

A digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of alternative currencies, or specifically of digital currencies.

- define "rigging"  What in VR is rigged?  WHy is it rigged?
***** Internet of Things*
The inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enable these objects to collect and exchange data In 2013 the Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things (IoT-GSI) defined the IoT as "the infrastructure of the information society." The IoT allows objects to be sensed or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to reduced human intervention.

***** 360 degrere video*
Also known as spherical videos, are video recordings where a view in every direction is recorded at the same time, shot using an omnidirectional camera or a collection of cameras. During playback the viewer has control of the viewing direction like a panorama.


***** Facial Recognition Systems*
A face recognition system is a computer application capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. One of the ways to do this is by comparing selected facial features from the image and a face database.

***** Biometric Software*
Biometrics refers to metrics related to human characteristics. Biometrics authentication (or realistic authentication) is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control.   It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance.

***** Volumetric Display*
A volumetric display device is a graphic display device that forms a visual representation of an object in three physical dimensions, as opposed to the planar image of traditional screens that simulate depth through a number of different visual effects. One definition offered by pioneers in the field is that volumetric displays create 3D imagery via the emission, scattering, or relaying of illumination from well-defined regions in (x,y,z) space. Though there is no consensus among researchers in the field, it may be reasonable to admit holographic and highly multiview displays to the volumetric display family if they do a reasonable job of projecting a three-dimensional light field within a volume.



***** *Python, C++, C#*
+ Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
​
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
​
C# is a multi paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma.   C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.



***** Emotio Recognition*

Emotion recognition is the process of identifying human emotion, most typically from facial expressions. This is both something that humans do automatically but computational methodologies have also been developed.​













*** Test
Once the experience has been designed and developed, we test.  This debugging process identifieds flaws in the code we repair.  The process assists in optimizing game-play and user experience.  

** Publishing
When acquiring XR for marketing purposes, we'll guide you to the proper portion of the market. With a few slight advancements, XR is best marketed under similar principles that have driven the digital marketing industry. 

*** Distribution
Depending on the XR solution that fits your mission, there are several ways in which your content can reach customers. One option is to arrange the hardware at your place of work and add XR to your in-house flow. A more expansive distribution form comes with publishing the content on a major VR app store - Oculus and Steam are two high-traffic destinations. Another option is to arrange your XR hardware and original content at remote locations, reaching folks while they're out in the physical world. This is similar channel distribution through a more immersive media.

*** Activation
Social media maintains a significant amount of attention at a rate below market value. Buying attention through social is still the route to travel along with native advertisements, that's your paid media. You still want to own social media handles and SEO keywords. The earned media comes more naturally with emerging technologies, as media outlets are eager to inform their readership about what's rising and who's rising with it. 

*** Data Review
With this hardware being affixed to the human body and with sensors just millimeters from the eyeballs, VR provides an opportunity to record and measure the sensory experience that occurs while customers are experiencing your content. Some of this data collection is referred to as biometric tracking. Factors like motivation, cognitive workload, emotional stress, tension, and eye movement are integrated into data reviews.

** Publications
We read, study, build relationships, and devise solutions. It's our work. Along the way we document our findings and provide them to you behind password-protected publications.

*** Financial Strategies
Upon receiving an assignment, our innovation lab dives into a research period, understanding and then communicating to you the most efficient path toward financial gain. These studies are customized to fit your company.

*** Market Research 
In the same vein we study the ways in which your company fits the current market climate - detailing the state of the market along with reflections and forecasts surrounding it. 

*** Lab Live
We draw more distant connections to a wide range of thought processes by relating to a wide range of people, concepts, and industries.

**** The Future of Storytelling
As I’ve been diving into the Virtual Reality world over the last six weeks, I’ve got to be honest…I haven’t know what's been going on in most conversations. Talks of biometrics and haptics and HTC Vive vs. Oculus and whether the artwork was created in Tiltbrush have sent me to YouTube to get caught up on industry basics.

Then, on Saturday morning I took a ride to a VR event on Staten Island — The Future of Storytelling. It resembles an art festival. Exhibits are set up outdoors and in their designated tents. There’s far more than VR available at FoST — there’s sound-based meditation, 360º video, live poetry, group experiments, silent theatrical performances, and live panel discussions. On top of that, there’s an ice cream truck from Brooklyn, juicers, Mexican food, and fresh fruit for sale.

The event is set up on the grounds of Snug Harbor Cultural Center, a sprawling local garden on the north end of Staten Island. It was 80 degrees on the first Saturday in October and an estimated 3,000 techies showed up.

In this writing, I’m going to confront what I’ve identified as a gap in the VR world — the ability to communicate its intricacies in layman’s terms.

Virtual Reality

VR is an emerging industry driven by people with elevated computer (or “machine”) literacy. By proxy, this is not an industry wrought with individuals who are expert in communicating this machine knowledge to the mainstream.

This, along with the high cost of the equipment, may to be one of the early reasons why extended reality has remained an underground movement. The mainstream is either unaware of this new media or hasn’t been able to understand it. On top of that, it’s difficult to describe with words these immersive experiences, which are completely separate from all forms of entertainment that have come before them.

How It Works

A user experiences Virtual Reality by putting on what’s referred to as a headmount. There are two major brands — HTC Vive (created by a Taiwanese software company and made available by an American digital distributor) and Oculus (purchased by Facebook in 2012). The headmount resembles ski goggles — with the front of the goggles featuring a mobile-phone-sized screen enclosed within. Once you’re eyes are inside the device and the experience begins, you’re now existing in a digital world. You look all around you, up and down, and use a set of controls to create the sensation that you’re physically moving through this virtual world.

What It Looks Like Inside

There are two types of VR visuals: 1) Interactive (these graphics appear similarly to video game graphics) and 2) 360º video (this content has been captured with a 360º camera and resembles the images you’d see on a TV screen or in a film). At The Future of StoryTelling, there were just as many experiences rooted in one form as the other.

Physiological Reaction

VR can cause the human mind to feel as though it’s falling off a ledge, driving on the highway, or flying above the desert. It challenges the laws of gravity and the passage of time and the perception of what’s happening to your body. The results can be equally as exhilarating as dizzying.

This is an element of the VR experience that can’t really be explained. How many of us know what it feels like to fly through outer space while looking down on the rotating earth? So the brain draws on what it has already experienced and tries to communicate to the body the physiological reactions that accompany these experiences.

Filming and Gaming

Just like was the case with the printing press, radio, television, and the internet, people are still learning how to create content for Virtual Reality. The natural tendency is to create what we know. For instance, the most common types of VR content right now are heavily related to one of two forms of entertainment: 1) Film or 2) Gaming. This is what we know to create.

This is a great place to start and it’s inspirational to witness people exploring the potential of VR. However, VR is not meant to be a new host for film nor gaming. Much of the content I saw at FoST was content that could have been communicated at the movie theatre or on a gaming device.

The content that does seem exclusive to VR seems also to be stuck in the “so what” phase. For instance, one of the most VR-specific experiences at FoST was called Preoration. Once you put on the goggles, you were taken into a desert where a 6-piece band was performing — they were the only six people visible for miles and miles. After spending a minute or two watching and listening to the band perform, a desert sandstorm began materializing in the distance. I could feel the wind on the back of my neck (from fans set up in the tent by the creators of the experience) and felt the nervousness of being caught in this storm. Then the sandstorm surrounded me and the performing band until I was eventually elevated above them. It felt as though I were in a hot air balloon as I rose and rose above the others. After a few more seconds I entered into a UFO and the image faded to darkness.

While I felt gratitude and admiration for the content creator’s ability to express through VR, I did not leave the experience with a clear sense of the medium’s purpose. Often when I interact with a piece of content I ask myself — what was the creator’s intent? What were they trying to communicate? Do I have the desire to come back?

The Breakthrough Is Coming

There is no doubt the breakthrough is coming. The technology is too advanced and the experience is too immersive and physiological for this not to be the next step in media. It’s also too similar to what humans have been seeking for centuries: the ability to control time and gravity. VR is the 21st century’s best attempt at time travel and teleportation.

**** Crossing The Chasm

This is an introduction to Nova Media’s two-part examination of Virtual Reality’s journey toward critical mass in the consumer market.

VR has a long and fragmented history dating all the way back to Morton Heilig in the 1950s. Then there was a simulation of Aspen, Colorado that came out of MIT in the late 70’s. A decade and a half later Sega announced the release of their first VR headset for an arcade game.

All of these…just a few of the breakthroughs that have led to predictions about how and when VR will make its significant impact on the consumer market.

But as the years passed we heard just a faint noise from this new virtual world playing in the background, often drowned out by HD TVs, smartphones, and social media.

The noise got louder, though, in 2014 when Facebook acquired Oculus and it’s new VR headset for over $2 billion. And then — at Oculus’ annual conference last month — a louder noise from Mark Zuckerberg, who said, “I am more committed than ever to the future of VR.”

So now, three years into Facebook’s involvement with this emerging technology, we’re still asking the question: when will VR reach critical mass?

In 1989 Geoffrey Moore wrote the first version of “Crossing The Chasm”, studying why, how, and at what rate new ideas and technologies spread through the market.

His book, which emerged in its third version three years ago, studies the tendencies with which young technologies progress through the adoption life cycle. The writing focuses on how these products often wind up stuck in the divide between the early adopters and the early majority. This can be a deadly place for a new technology to try and survive, as the early majority makes up 1/3 of the market.

This series will examine where VR stands in relation to this curve, what’s prevented it from breaking through, and what will need to happen in order for it to cross the next divide.

**** Off The Ground

This Is The 2nd in a Nova XR Media's two-part series.

As we study the way a new technology progresses through the Adoption Lifecycle, we realize the innovators have already captured Virtual Reality.

Geoffrey Moore describes the innovators as a group of technology enthusiasts who appreciate the tech for its own sake. They don’t need to believe it will break through in the market nor that it holds the potential for greater achievement. The innovators savor in the technology for everything it is — whether it’s the smooth texture of the software or it’s painfully slow operating speed.

With Facebook having committed a multi-billion-dollar investment and MIT using Facebook’s new VR headset to allow humans first person control of robots, the innovators have their hands on Virtual Reality.


The early adopters come in behind the innovators and bring their vision. Moore calls them, “That rare breed of people who have the insight to match up an emerging technology to a strategic opportunity, the temper to translate that insight into a high-visibility, high-risk project, and the charisma to get the rest of their organization to buy into that project…the core of their dream is a business goal, not a technology goal.”

Well, as we approach 2018, VR has extended its reach all the way to Lowe’s, who’s incorporated a Holoroom to allow customers immersive experiences such as shifting the paint color on the walls of their new room. This means homeowners who may work in any range of industries have experienced VR inside a building operated by one of the strongest brands in the country.

While reaching this level of audience is an advanced step for the technology, it’s an indication of Lowe’s reaching right to left across the chasm and becoming an early adopter.

We see evidence of this with CNBC’s report that estimates Facebook sold fewer than 400,000 units of their Oculus Rift in 2016. Remember, the early majority represents one third of the market, so if the largest tech giant didn’t break ½ million sales in its first year, we understand that VR has yet to cross over.

**** The Father of VR

[[file:https://www.dropbox.com/s/xxo0acsvprqh0ti/Morton%20Heilig%20Photo.jpg?dl=0]]

There were a few middle-aged guys over the studio last month and I referred to VR as a “new technology.” One of them seemed ready to catch me on this and drop a mention of how VR has been around for decades and how our studio should know all about this — being that we produce it and all.

“A new technology?” he asked with a suspicious tone.

“Well,” I said. “If you really wanted to you could go all the way back to Morton Heilig in the 1950s and begin the story of VR back then.”

Mentioning that name was, in itself, enough to prevent any further suspicion. But if the gentleman had asked me to speak any more about Heilig I wouldn’t have been able to.

I remembered that an old guy on the back patio of the coffee shop in Red Hook had labeled him as “The Father of VR” back in the fall, but beyond that I didn’t know much more.

So, I spent last night reading about him and what he brought to an industry that is, more than half a century later, still budding.

Born in 1926, Heilig established himself as a cinematographer, using that background to eventually develop and patent two pieces of technology: “the telesphere mask” and the “Sensorama.” He and his partner began the development of these machines in 1957, patenting them in 1962.

A bulky piece of technology shaped like an old-school arcade game, the sensorama allowed the user to sit on a chair and lean their head into the equipment — kinda like you would the vision machine at the optometrist. One of the first experiences available in the Sensorama was of a motorcycle ride through Brooklyn. Heilig attempted to incorporate all the senses and draw the viewer into a cinematic experience — a very similar description of what we understand VR to be more than 60 years later. He referred to it as “Experience Theatre.”

He published a paper in 1955 called the “The cinema of the future” in which he detailed a multi-sensory theatre experience. The first text that appears inside the document reads, “Thus, individually and collectively, by thoroughly applying the methodology of art, the cinema of the future will become the first art form to reveal the new scientific world to man in the full sensual vividness and dynamic vitality of his consciousness.”

After this writing he went on to create the sensorama and five short film displays. The machine still functions to this day.

Eventually, Heilig said he wasn’t able to capture high enough quality images from 35mm film cameras in order to create an immersive experience that was marketable enough to the general public.

Here’s the link to his 1955 research paper. https://gametechdms.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/w6_thecinemaoffuture_morton.pdf
