# Blockchain

## How is Blockchain relavent to VR?
- secure transactions
- general stability of the platform
- allowance of microtransactions
- Fair rewards for publishers, no payment cuts


A "block"-"chain" is a distributed database (or ledger) that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records.  This continously growing ordered list is called a "block".  It is connecting linearly to the other blocks, and making it a "chain" of blocks.  Features, such as "smart contracts" allow us to host concerts in VR with secure micro-transactions and affirmed security.

## Imutable
Blocks are designed to be inherently resistant to modification of the data — once recorded the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively. 

## Distributed
Records are spread evenly throughout all participants.  In virtual reality, collaborative

## Smart contract 
An agreement fascilitated by a computer protocol, enforcing the delivery of agreed terms without a third party (human).  Transactions are secure, trackable and irreversible.


## automated
Through peer-to-peer networks and a distributed timestamping server, a blockchain database is managed autonomously.

A VR on blockchain can form the ultimate democracy with an independent economy and freedom from the regulation of any governing body outside of itself.   We can build new life, economy and power-structure with the combination of these techonlogies.  In fact, we already have.
