Cloud Computing

* Abstract

Cloud computing is the remote storage, access, and control of computers. A "cloud" is really just a server. Storing in the cloud merely means you are storing your data on someone else's' hard drive. For example, iCloud is storing you data on Apple's hardware, instead of your own local drive.
