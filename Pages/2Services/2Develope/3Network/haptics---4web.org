Haptics

* Abstract

“Haptics” represents the communication to devices through touch and feel, as a reaction to an action. This is the science of applying tactile sensations to controllers so they can interact with computer applications.   

Add a visceral dimension to virtual experiences and 3D environments, most frequently by applying vibration or electrostatic shock. By using ex-devices, like gloves, vests, shoes and so on, the player receives non-verbal, non-visual feedback from the computer. 

Virtual experiences that train surgeons and athletes rely on haptic technology to train muscles so they can maneuver with better precision.  Our hands determine hardness, shape, temperature, texture, weight and more. There is a lot to be understood through touch. Haptics development is a major part of the immersive experience.
