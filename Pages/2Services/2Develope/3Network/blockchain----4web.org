* Abstract

A "block"-"chain" is aÂ distributed database (or ledger) that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records.  Some major blockchain features include: 

- Secure, private transactions
- Microtransactions
- Public, imutable record keeping
- Democratized administrative controm 
- General platform stability


Features, such as "smart contracts" allow us to host concerts in VR with secure micro-transactions.  An inumeral amount of people can attend concerts and experiences live with musicians and artists.  On a blockchain, you can charge them based on network contribution.  

Blockchain tech allows the users to exclusively own and control them content and platform the build.
