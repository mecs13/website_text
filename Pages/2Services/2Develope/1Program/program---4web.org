Game Engine

* Second

A *game engine* is a software framework used to create interactive 3D media (XR).  We build XR in game engines.  

* Abstract 

Game engines enable all the features of the internet from social sharing to payment.  They equip developers to custom design virtual environments, program players, goals and rules as applications shared and experienced throgh personal computers, mobile dvices and gaming consules. Game engine framework's core functions are to render 3D graphics, engineer physics/collision (and response systems) manage memoreym shread, and graph scenes.   

Nova economizes the process of virtual reality (XR) development by adapting game engine builds (software executable) to create new VR expereinces.   By developing with foresight producers save time and money.
