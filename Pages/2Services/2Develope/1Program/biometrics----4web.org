Biometrics

* Abstract


Biometrics refers to metrics related to human biological characteristics, including physiology and neurology. In Virtual Reality biometrics are used to measure interest, entertainment, and intent.   

By monitoring physiological cues such as skin galvanization, eye dilation, heart and breathing rate, computers infer and extrapolate further details about the player and their experience.

This enables us to remove the many errors and barriers that stand between the user and feedback. By using bio-measurements we improve the storyline and pinpoint the player's interest, displeasure, fatigue, excitement and much more.  

The seven primary emotions monitored in traditional commercial software are happiness, sadness, anger, contempt, fear, disgust, and surprise.
