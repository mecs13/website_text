A physics engine is the technology that allows objects to behave in the Virtual World similarly to the way the behave in the physical world. Itâ€™s a means through which the laws of gravity are incorporated into Extended Reality. 

For businesses interested in an XR solution that required objects to obey the laws of gravity, a physics engine will be a crucial element of your project development.
