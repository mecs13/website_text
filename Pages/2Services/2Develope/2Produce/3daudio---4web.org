3D Audio

* Content 

3D audio is the concept of manipulating sound waves so - even when they come from a speaker - the human ear perceives the sounds as though theyâ€™re coming from various points in a physical space. By working with head related transfer function (HRTF), this technology is able to mimic natural sounds waves (which originate from a point in space) and lead us to believe the sounds are coming from above, below, behind, or anywhere else within the three dimensions. 

As you incorporate your own XR solution, 3D audio enhances the lifelike feeling presented to the user by presenting a more diverse sensory experience.
