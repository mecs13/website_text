Broadcasting live streamed content reduces the barrier to creating your own Virtual content. By placing a 360 camera in any space with an internet connection and tethering it to a mobile or desktop device, you can stream live content across your social media channels on the spot. On the receiving end, anyone with a headset can connect to their own device and experience the 360 content inside VR. 

Birthday parties, holiday celebrations, sporting events, concerts, workout sessions, and other remote events can reach the user at home (or anywhere with an internet connection) through this minimal process.
