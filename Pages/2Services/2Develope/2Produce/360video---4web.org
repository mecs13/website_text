360 Video

A 360 camera uses multiple lenses to record various shot angles without moving the device. Once captured theyâ€™re stitched together into a spherical digital environment that aligns and balances color grade - creating an atmosphere we can explore multidimensionally inside the VR headset.  

Instead of expended time and money on traditional modes of transportation to travel to a different three-dimensional environment, we can now do so from inside this hardware.
