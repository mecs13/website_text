Projection Mapping 

* Content

Think of projection mapping as a combination of Virtual and Augmented Reality that does not require a headset. This technology projects images and variations of light and movement onto the walls of a space, so everyone inside is together within the experience. 

Projection mapping is most applicable in cases where itâ€™s important to the vendor that the members of the group remain together in the physical world while experiencing digital visual enhancement. It can be a useful solution for business models that encourage the customer to engage in body movement (dancing, exercising, exploring).
