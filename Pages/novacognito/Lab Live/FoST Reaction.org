As I’ve been diving into the Virtual Reality world over the last six weeks, I’ve got to be honest...I haven’t know what they hell’s been going on in most conversations. Talks of biometrics and haptics and HTC Vive’s vs. Oculus and whether the artwork was created in Tiltbrush have sent me to YouTube to get caught up on industry basics.

Then, on Saturday morning I took a ride to a VR event on Staten Island - The Future of Storytelling. It resembles an art festival. Exhibits are set up outdoors and in their designated tents. There’s far more than VR available at FoST - there’s sound-based meditation, 360º video, live poetry, group experiments, silent theatrical performances, and live panel discussions. On top of that, there's an ice cream truck from Brooklyn, Juicers, Mexican food, and fresh fruit for sale. 

The event is set up on the grounds of Snug Harbor Cultural Center, a sprawling local garden on the north end of Staten Island. It was 80 degrees on the first Saturday in October and an estimated 3,000 techies showed up. 

In this writing, I'm going to confront what I've identified as a gap in the VR world - the ability to communicate its intricacies in layman’s terms.

Virtual Reality is an emerging industry driven by people with elevated computer (or “machine”) literacy. By proxy, this is not an industry wrought with individuals who're expert in communicating this machine knowledge to the mainstream. 

This, along with the high cost of the equipment, may to be one of the early reasons why extended reality has remained an underground movement. The mainstream is either unaware of this new media or hasn't been able to understand what it is exactly. On top of that, it’s difficult to describe with words these immersive experiences, which are completely separate from all forms of entertainment that have come before them.

VR 101

A user experiences Virtual Reality by putting on what’s referred to as a headmount. There are two major brands of headmounts - HTC Vive (created by the video game producer Valve) and Oculus (purchased by Facebook in 2012). The headmount resembles ski goggles with the front of the goggles featuring a mobile-phone-sized screen enclosed within. Once you're eyes are inside the device and the experience begins, you’re now existing in a digital world. You look all around you, up and down, and use a set of controls to create the sensation that you're physically moving through this virtual world.

How Content is Generated:

There are two types of VR content: 1) Interactive (these graphics appear similarly to video game graphics) and  2) 360º video (this content has been captured with a 360º camera and resembles the types of images you’d see on a TV screen or in a film). At The Future of StoryTelling, there were just as many experiences rooted one form as in the other. 

Physiological Reaction 

VR can cause the human mind to feel as though it’s falling off a ledge, driving on the highway, or flying above the desert. It challenges the laws of gravity and the passage of time and the perception of what’s happening to your body. The results can be equally as exhilarating as they are dizzying. 

This is an element of the VR experience that can’t really be explained. How many of us know what it feels like to fly through outer space while looking down on the rotating earth? The brain draws on what it has already experienced and tries to communicate to the body the physiological reactions that accompany these experiences. 

Filming and Gaming 

Just like was the case with the printing press, radio, television, and the internet, people are still learning how to create content for Virtual Reality. The natural tendency is to create what we know. For instance, the most common types of VR content right now are heavily related to one of two forms of entertainment: 1) Film or 2) Gaming. This is what we know to create, and as we’re in the infancy of the VR movement, content creators are essentially bringing film and or gaming to this new form of media.

This is a great start and it’s inspirational to witness people exploring the potential of VR. However, VR is not here to be a new host for film and gaming. Much of the content I saw this weekend at FoST was content that could have been communicated at the movie theatre or on a gaming device. 

The content that does seem exclusive to VR seems overwhelmingly blah. While I walked away from these VR-specific experiences admiring the content creators for their attempt to embody the medium rather than knocking off previous mediums, I was severely stuck in what fiction writers often refer to as the “so what” phase. I wasn’t able to understand why I’d just gone through that experience or what the creator was trying to tell me. 

One of the most VR-specific experiences at FoST was called Preoration. Once you put on the goggles, you were taken into a desert where a 6-piece band was performing - they were the only six people visible for miles and miles. After spending a minute or two watching and listening to the band perform, a desert sandstorm began materializing in the distance. I could feel the wind on the back of my neck (from fans set up in the tent by the creators of the experience) and felt the nervousness of being caught in this storm. Then the sandstorm surrounded me and the performing band until I was eventually elevated above them. It felt as though I were in a hot air balloon as I rose and rose above the others. After a few more seconds I entered into a UFO and the image faded to darkness. 

While I felt gratitude and admiration for the content creator’s ability to express through VR, I did not leave the experience with a clear sense of its purpose. Often when I interact with a piece of content I ask myself - what was the creator’s intent? What were they trying to communicate? 

This leads me to believe that we have not yet reached the major innovative breakthrough of  Virtual Reality content creation. VR is still waiting for it’s first great awakening. 

The Breakthrough Is Coming

There is no doubt that the breakthrough is coming.. This tech is too advanced. There are too many qualified people working on it, and it’s too similar to what humans have been seeking for centuries: the ability to control time and gravity and to move from one place to the next with just a thought. VR is the 21st century’s best attempt at time travel and teleportation, but as long as content creators remain too heavily influenced by video gaming and by film, this potential will remain intangible.
