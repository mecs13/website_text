For anyone who collaborates on work "GIT".

Far from a computer scientist this

- easy to use, very adoptable
- get hooked on Git
- inutitive style



- distributed repository


** The first three chapters are key

** Chapter 1

*** version control systems

- records changes of files
- allows yiur to revert files back to previous state (entire project too)
- compare changes over time
- see who las tmodified omething that is causing  problem (GIT BLAME!)

**** Local version control system
copying files into another directory, even time-stamped, is somewhat clever, but prone to error, and unfun to debug. which directory did i last write in?  Did I copy over those files? fuckk....

- popular VCS tool is RCS ( a command when you install dev tools).  it can recreate what any file looks like, at any time, by adding up all the patches.

**** Centralized version control systems - collaborating with other developers
- CVCS, sch as Subversion, Perforce, CVS, have a single server 
***** advatanges over VCS, such as 
    +  everyone knows (to a certain extent) what everyone else on the project is doing
    +  admins have fine-grained control voer who can do what
    +  centralized work for admin
***** disadvatanges
    + single point of failure (if servergoes down , no one can work at all or saved versioned changed) 
    + hard disk corrupts, we be fucked, because only local snap shots will exist

*** History of GIT

"creative destruction and fiery controversy."


Linux Kernal , open source software project, , which began using proprietary DVCS called bitkeeper in 2002.
# bitkeeper
# linuix

relationship broke down, bitkeeper wanted money, and Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, decided to dev their own tool, pulling from what they learned from BK.

System goals were 
-speed
- simple design
- strong support for non-leanr dev (thousands of parallel banches) 
- fully distributed
- can handle large projects

GIT DONE BE BORN - and is still Grreaat.  it's incredibly fast, efficient with large scale prjects, and incredible branching ssytem for non-linear dev


*** Git basics

Its different that other versioning systems, so like in mathematic, FORGET WHAT YOU KNOW


Git thinks about data differnt






** Chapter 2
- clone a repository
- project histry
- modify files
- contribute changes

** Chapter 3
- branching model (the killer feature)
