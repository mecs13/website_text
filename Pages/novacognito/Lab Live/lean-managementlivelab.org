I have to learn what it means to be /lean/. It's on my TODOs. So I bumped some music and sat at my text editor, writing this.

/Lean/ gives start-ups a framework to innovate, sustain, and become profitable. Basically, produce development methodology - answering, /Can this product yield a worthy return on investment?/

The aim is to shorten the product development cycle. We accomplish this in /lean/ methodology by:

(1) Experimenting with a business-hypothesis focus. IE, experiment to learn about the prospective business models, financial strategies, and marketability of our product.

(2) Iterative product releases, as in: make-test-and-adapt products quickly.  This prevents over-spending on non-commercially viable ideas, and miss-allocating resources on unachievable goals.

(3) Validated learning - which is to measure the success against potential customers, with their feedback being the "validation" of what we learned.

For a businessman, it appears /lean/ is a business-first approach to tech development. For example, of course you start with a business hypothesis and an understanding of whether there is money at the end of a particular road. Why else get involved? Iterative process to me is keeping a close eye on whether your team is getting off track. Validated learning is simply "testing the market.”

A build-measure-learn process will get us to our MVP (minimum viable product). Along the way, keep asking questions. Poke holes. Insist on proof of information. I prefer to favor an experienced person’s gut over a scientifically proven fact sheet.  However, watch who you consider an "experts".  Ask "who”, "what", "why", "when”, "where”, and “how” enough times that you can pitch your idea to a scrutinizing buyer without having to bullshit.   

The key to a /lean/ startup is managing innovation without losing control. Give the team freedom to experiment and develop new ideas, while keeping them on objective and out of rabbit holes.

To summarize, /lean/ is to test a hypothesis and turn ideas into viable products. You will receive your feedback on viability by testing the market. You can keep one simple question top of mind.

Who makes money, when?
