The Father of VR

There were a few middle-aged guys over the studio last month and I referred to VR as a “new technology.” One of them seemed ready to catch me on this and drop a mention of how VR has been around for decades and how our studio should know all about this — being that we produce it and all.

“A new technology?” he asked with a suspicious tone.

“Well,” I said. “If you really wanted to you could go all the way back to Morton Heilig in the 1950s and begin the story of VR back then.”

Mentioning that name was, in itself, enough to prevent any further suspicion. But if the gentleman had asked me to speak any more about Heilig I wouldn’t have been able to.

I remembered that an old guy on the back patio of the coffee shop in Red Hook had labeled him as “The Father of VR” back in the fall, but beyond that I didn’t know much more.

So, I spent last night reading about him and what he brought to an industry that is, more than half a century later, still budding.

Born in 1926, Heilig established himself as a cinematographer, using that background to eventually develop and patent two pieces of technology: “the telesphere mask” and the “Sensorama.” He and his partner began the development of these machines in 1957, patenting them in 1962.

A bulky piece of technology shaped like an old-school arcade game, the sensorama allowed the user to sit on a chair and lean their head into the equipment — kinda like you would the vision machine at the optometrist. One of the first experiences available in the Sensorama was of a motorcycle ride through Brooklyn. Heilig attempted to incorporate all the senses and draw the viewer into a cinematic experience — a very similar description of what we understand VR to be more than 60 years later. He referred to it as “Experience Theatre.”

He published a paper in 1955 called the “The cinema of the future” in which he detailed a multi-sensory theatre experience. The first text that appears inside the document reads, “Thus, individually and collectively, by thoroughly applying the methodology of art, the cinema of the future will become the first art form to reveal the new scientific world to man in the full sensual vividness and dynamic vitality of his consciousness.”

After this writing he went on to create the sensorama and five short film displays. The machine still functions to this day.

Eventually, Heilig said he wasn’t able to capture high enough quality images from 35 mm film cameras in order to create an immersive experience that was marketable enough to the general public.
