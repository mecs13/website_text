4th July - Delaware Water Gap

* Abstract

Live Stream from the Delaware River, off-roading, kayaking, camping.     

Where George Washington lead his continental army, we will be on an AR scavenger hunt.  Maps will be auto genereted with a public and private key for play verification. It is a 36 hour hunt for geo targeted clues that lead to a crypto-hardware-wallet and a pneumonic phrase.   If you don't collect all clues, you might not get the phrase.
