4th July - Delaware Water Gap

* Abstract

Live Stream from the Delaware River, off-roading, kayaking, camping.     

Where George Washington led the Continental Army, we will be on an AR scavenger hunt. Maps will be auto-generated with a public and private key for play verification. It is a 36 hour hunt for geo targeted clues that lead to a crypto-hardware-wallet and a mnemonic phrase. If you don't collect all the clues, you might not get the phrase.
