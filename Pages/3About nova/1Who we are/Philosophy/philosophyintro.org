* Philosophy;

/Do unto others/

As pioneers our duty is to explore new media, publish our findings, and map the way.

The fringe of technology is full of ethical complexities and it is our responsibility to set a high moral standard for the industry.

We lead by example, challenge traditional structures and fight for underdogs.

/We Dream Awake./
