Classic New York Backdrop

* Content 

Located on the water with a clear view of the New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty, our studio is ideal for a classic or abstract New York City photoshoot. 

Especially during magic hour when the sun is setting to the south of Lady Liberty and the low orange light streams through and accents the exposed brick and interior stone...

We invite you to capture.
