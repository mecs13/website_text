* Abstract

Virtual Reality will democratize experience.

Consider how the internet democratized information. 

The internet has globalized us.  We communicate, share, and do business with people around the world - most we've never met in person.  Maybe never seen their face or heard their voice - but we /know/ them.

XR empowers remote acess to in-person experiences, through shared virtual environments. 

If we really knew what it was like to walk in another's shoes, we'd be humbled.  If we visited the places our governments declared as enemies, we'd ask more questions.   If we knew first hand the horrors of war, the inhumanity of greed, and the glory of love, we'd live differently.      

Virtual Reality will democratize experience, and can bring world peace.
