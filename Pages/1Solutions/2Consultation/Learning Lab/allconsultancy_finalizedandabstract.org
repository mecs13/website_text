# introduction

We’ll help you understand, operate, integrate, and troubleshoot XR technologies.  The skills required to produce 3d virtual media (XR) are broad and deep, but we'll keep you focused.  By internalizing the basics of xr hardware and xr software you'll be familiar with why the latest technological breakthroughs and understand /why/ they are indeed /break-throughs/.

Then, you'll come up with innovative ways to improve your business.  Ways in which the competition is not yet equiped to think up themselves.   

Arm yourself for knowledge and you'll be equipped to succeed in this new era of media technologies.   With tech moving at an exponential rate, virtual/augmented reality, artificial inteliigence, robotics, block-chains, the internet of things, and more...there will be many more "Blockbusters, Borders Books, Kodaks and so on)  

“The future is already here – it's just not evenly distributed.

Stay current on a spectrum of technologies that are intertwining 
in the new era of augmented experiences.  

As mechanical and biological blend, we’ll keep the light 
shining on programs that matter.  

#  Virtual vs. Augemnted Reality

## Aumented reality

- Alters the real world on a screen or head-mounted screen.

- feels like the world is your canvas

- lets you collaboratively create

## VR and AR

- Allows you to interact with digital media

- Create nonreal geometry and retina displays 

- Programmed in coding languages C++, javascript, WebGL, python, C# and many others.  

- Spatial cognitive information


## Virtual Reality

- creates entirely virtual world

- feels like teleporting to a different dimension

- lets you exist in alternet worlds with other humans to train, learn or play.

# Needs Analysis
     
We provide access to advance technologies and advise on related markets.  As needed we can source development, manage project execution and publish experiences.  How can we help you?

# Sourcing Development
 
We scout deliver top  talent from around the world   

We often hire third-party developers to increase net profits, and to improve internet access to remote parts of the world through program /NovaCaine/  

The business arrangement between the developers is governed by a contract, which specifies a list of milestones intended to be delivered over a period of time. By tracking and adapting milestones we manage development rate, hours and deadlines.  Nova work is guarenteed.   

# Training

## Basic Training:

This is a 3-month, light-load training course with weekly lessons customized to your business and goals.  

We'll come set you up witht the basic equipment and familiarize you and your team with xr hardware that can run virtual reality and other GPU-intesive programs.   

We'll meet weekly to cordinate the project's design and educate you on news, software, middleware and netowrking as it pertains to your business.  Every project is different and there is no catch-all solution to being educated.  Your feedback, leanring style and strengths drive the lesson plans.  We commit 10-hours a week, two collaboratively to work with you one on one, and the rest to developing your ideas.  This approach keeps you available to your tradiational responsibilities, while still captaining the ship.     
   

After 12 weeks we will deliver a full development specification, including the technical architecture, produciton timeline, expenses and financial strategy.
