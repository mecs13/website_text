***** Sourcing Development
 
We scout deliver top  talent from around the world   

We often hire third-party developers to increase net profits, and to improve internet access to remote parts of the world through program /NovaCaine/  

The business arrangement between the developers is governed by a contract, which specifies a list of milestones intended to be delivered over a period of time. By tracking and adapting milestones we manage development rate, hours and deadlines.  Nova work is guarenteed.
