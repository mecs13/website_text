*Why develop customized XR Media?*

* Abstract

Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) are two exponential technologies
categorized as "Extended Reality" (XR), which create 3D media using spatial computations
in real time. They will increasingly become a part of our everyday. By wearing a "head
mounted display" (HMD), one will engage simulated environments, digital models, and
other dynamic information for entertainment, education, productivity, and much more.
Twenty-five percent of the US population will have adopted AR/VR in their homes in the
next five years. (Smart phones reached 25% in 2011)

XR Media can be the ultimate communication tool, or the reason your business falls
behind. XR is the next frontier of human connectivity.
