* Abstract

XR [Extended Reality], such as Virtual reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) empower communication, collaboration and learning. XR media is interactive, dynamic and conscious of space.  

These technologies will increasingly be in the home. Through your phone (or XR glasses/goggles) you can engage simulated environments, digital models, and other dynamic 3D information for entertainment, education, productivity, and much more.

Historical rates of technological adoption suggest twenty-five percent of the US population will have an AR/VR in their homes in the next five years.

XR Media can be the ultimate communication tool, or the reason your business falls
behind. 

XR is the next frontier of human connectivity.
