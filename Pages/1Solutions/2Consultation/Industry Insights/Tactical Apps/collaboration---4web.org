* Abstract

Virtual Chat Rooms let us seemingly stand in the same room as another, thought millions of miles away.   Through thin flexible fibers with a glass core light signals (fiber optics) send data and information at a rate of 50Mps.  Our movements and voices are read and replicated for recipeients to experience in sumulation software, that we are now calling "virtual reality".
