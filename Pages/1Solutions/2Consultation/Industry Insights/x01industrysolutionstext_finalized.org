* Abstract 

Education, Public Health, Travel, Entertainment, Space Exploration, Real Estate, Architecture, Design, and many more industries are finding solutions to their gravest challenges with the application of immersive media by extending reality (XR).   The adoption of 3D computing will become as ubiquitous as mobile devices are today. However, uncovering solutions and making use of the technology is up to us.  Share your challenge and we can find a solution together. 

***** Healthcare: PTSD (neuro rehab)
What-creating lifelike sensory experience to incentivize the patient to work toward recovery
What-relieving phantom pain that can often emerge during rehab or treatment process
Why-Patients are often deincentivized or inflicted with mental blocks and the perception of pain
How-Use of biometrics, haptics, 3D audio

***** Real Estate:
What-Bring prospective buyer inside the home they're considering for purchase
Why-Reduce travel cost, increase convenience, increase number of properties viewable in a single day.
How-Photogrammetry interior of property

***** Sports
What-Place the athlete in a game-like situation to simulate the challenges they'll face, 
Why-Increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the athlete's training regimen and make them more prepared for game action.
How-simulation and motion tracking of the body.

***** Retail:
What - allow the customer to chose the color, style, and texture of the products they're considering as purchase items.
Why - afford the customer a more intimate interaction with the product. This is similar to the difference in effectiveness between a a radio ad. and TV ad. The more sensory appeal the more likely to buy.
How - incorporate color, texture, styles into VR game engine through XR color.

***** Architecture:
What - allow architects the opportunity to sketch, measure, and create a 3D image of the structure they're building. Google's tiltbrush is a generic example of this concept. 
Why - Bring the blueprint off the page and into 3D, uniting the architect with his vision in a 3D environment
How- prototyping
****** Cross Platform virtual reality enviironments
        designed in virtaul reaity engines, traditional used for video game making, to produce interactive 3d environemtns to put you inside of your deisgns.
****** Scenario Planning
Your own 3d models transformed into VR environments for you to engage and interact with, manipulate and asses the constribtability impacts or costs.
****** Timely and cost effective
accomplish more, quicker, by better comprehensiving you work by 

***** Music:
What-Allow the fan be at a live performance
What-Afford them the opportunity to learn how to play music
What- allow bands to relocate in VR 
Why-To satiate people's desire to become more closely connected to their favorite artists

"In the race to adopt new technologies, the music industry historically has finished just ahead of the Amish." - Stan Cornyn

But hopefully, this time, Stan is wrong.   Music is being greatly enhanced by virtual experiences because we can add another dimension to the sounds, we can control the visuals.   Not just visualizing the music, but creating an environment that is a part of the music.   Sure, heavy hitters like Kanye West and Tiesto already do this, but it takes tens of thousands of dollars in production, huge teams and a ton of equipment to alter the physical world’s atmosphere to synchronize with the music and illicit such emotion provoking content.  Simply, it is too costly for the common man, and music is all about the common man, so get ready for a new wave of sound
