** Surveillance

Virtual Reality is personal-information vacuum that sits on your face.  All of our actions, reactions, muscle tensions, eye movements, micro-expressions, even some of your thinking strategies, are being logged and indexed by VR hardware.   The most data-happy people-miners in the world, Facebook, Google, /et cetera/ are behind the mass collection of intimate info, and way ahead of the law.  

You cannot stop by the rain, but we reccomend you educate yourself on the perils we as a society face.  To start, research and understand data-capitalism.  There is no further information available here because this is not our feild of expertise.
