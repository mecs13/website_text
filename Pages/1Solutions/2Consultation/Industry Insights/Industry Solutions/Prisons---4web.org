 Prisons
VR allows for the incarcerated to experience life outside of prison. Rehabilitation efforts using VR to demonstrate ordinary life helps acclimate convicts for when they leave prison. The ability to see your family and play games in VR improves morale among inmates. Many convicts return to prison for inability to adapt to their old lives, but using technology to ease them into it can reduce readmittance.
