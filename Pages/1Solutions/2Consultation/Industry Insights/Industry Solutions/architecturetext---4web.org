XR Architecture 

* Abstract

Allow architects the opportunity to sketch, measure, and create a 3D image of the structure they're building. Google's tiltbrush is a generic example of this concept. This will bring the blueprint off the page and into 3D, uniting the architect with his vision in a 3D environment.  We do it through CAD designs being ported into executables produced in game engines.
