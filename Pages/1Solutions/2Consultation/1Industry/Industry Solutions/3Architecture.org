XR Architecture 

* Abstract

Allow architects the opportunity to sketch, measure, and create a 3D image of the structure they're building. Google's TiltBrush program is a generic example of this concept. This will bring the blueprint off the page and into 3D, uniting the architects with their vision in a 3D environment. We carry this out by porting CAD designs into executables produced in game engines.

****** Cross Platform Virtual Reality environments
Designed in Virtual Reality engines (traditionally used for video game creation), these interactive 3D environments are created for the inside of your designs. 

****** Scenario Planning
Transform your own 3D models into VR environments and interact with them, manipulating and assessing the constructability, impact, and cost.

****** Timely and Cost Effective
VR leads to richer comprehension and retention for the user. This allows you to accomplish more at a quicker rate.
