Religion
Classrooms learning about religion can implement VR visuals to have children interact with the scenes they are learning about. This increases connection to religion and excitement among kids to be involved in religious life. This directly correlates with higher young adult and child population at places of worship. VR is an infinite space, which allows for infinite possibilities in expressing the divine.
