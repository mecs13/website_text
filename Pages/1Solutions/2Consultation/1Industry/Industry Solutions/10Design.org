Design is divine

* Abstract

Design represents one of the most natural transitions into the virtual world. This term is incorporated into XR in two forms. 

1) Preplanning: All major projects go through a preliminary design phase. Before major architectural, construction, transportation or assembly projects are configured in the physical world, they’re first outlined on a computer screen. Virtual Reality has introduced an intermediary step between this pre planning process and it’s real-world incorporation. Developing and experiencing these projects in the Virtual World before breaking ground in the physical world is becoming a crucial portion of the process. 

2) With the Virtual World maturing, more companies are seeking three-dimensional artwork. Logos, animations, and 3D renders are moving to the forefront of brand mentality. As entertainment and commerce shift into 3D you’re brand will have to do the same.
