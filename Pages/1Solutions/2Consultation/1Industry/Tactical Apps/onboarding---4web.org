On-boarding

* Abstract

What if you knew your potential new hire better than they knew themself?   In XR we can learn a great deal very quickly from peoples' choices in simulated environments.   Learn if and when fight/flight kicks in.  How one reacts to confrontation.  How often they are late, and why.  XR is a supreme HR tool because it connects information to the people we're managing more plentifully than ever.
