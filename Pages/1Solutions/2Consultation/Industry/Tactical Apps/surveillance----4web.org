XR Surveillance  

* Abstract

Virtual Reality is a personal-information vacuum that rests centimeters from your eyes. All of our actions, reactions, muscle tensions, eye movements, micro-expressions, even some of your thinking strategies, are logged and indexed by VR hardware. The most data-happy people-miners in the world, Facebook, Google, et cetera are behind the mass collection of intimate info and way ahead of the law.
You cannot stop by the train, so we recommend you educate yourself on the perils we as a society face. To start, research and understand data-capitalism. There is no further information available here because this is not our field of expertise.
