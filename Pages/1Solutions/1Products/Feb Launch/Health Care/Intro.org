As folks recover from major injuries and debilitating illnesses, the recovery road is long and winding. Virtual Reality offers these patients a wide range of opportunities to manage the physical and mental stresses of rehabilitation. Immersive virtual experiences (some with 3D audio) are able to recreate for the human senses events and environments that could serve as a form of therapy for a person injured in combat, on a construction site, or in an automobile accident. As we step into the Virtual World we're also letting VR into the mind and accessing the healing powers of this technology.

Design Ideas: 

1) Color therapy, forest, disabled people are able to travel the world. 

2) motion tracking of ppl in VR
