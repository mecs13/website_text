For an athlete, the most valuable aspect of preparing for competition is creating the most game-like atmosphere possible. For decades, coaches and players have experimented with practice squads who've memorized the tendencies of the upcoming opponent, film study to examine recent competitions, and even attempted to simulate various climates - preparing for cold, snow, rain, high altitude, humidity, and other elements. 

As we stretch further into the 21st century, Virtual Reality is now putting the athlete inside the film, creating a virtual practice session. By donning the VR headmount, quarterbacks, home run hitters, point guards, goalies, and any other athletes who rely on film study of the opposition can now immerse themselves in a lifelike game simulation that offers angles and visuals beyond anything available in the film room.
