Location and Information Navigation

Exploring the infinite places and things, virtual reality finally allows us to traverse. Itâ€™s a game-changing resource for so many industries. But users knowledge of, and comfort with, the technology can vary greatly, which can cause vastly different user experiences. The real value of new technology tends to remain untapped because learning curves for new technology usually remain steep until a considerate and practical user interface is developed. Virtual reality is no different, and Bloomaway is that considerate and practical interface.

Bloomaway is a truly innovative and intuitive VR interface that allows users to easily navigate locations and information. Bloomaway's interface is driven by three key elements: Attention, Intention, and Context. Attention is where a user is looking, intention is typically what a user attempts to touch, and context is being aware of when and where the other two elements are happening. With these seemingly simple elements, we can build a universe intertwined with our actions.
