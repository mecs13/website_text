1) Makes sense to experience same energy flow in VR that all beings in the universe experience

2) A Torus consists of a central axis with a vortex at both the top and bottom through which energy enters and exits the user's field of vision. Once the enrgy leaves through the top of the Torus, it is recycled and flows back through th bottom of the system 
-Plants and animals all experience this same energetic flow

3) VR has not yet established a smooth and intuitive way for the user to interact with this new reality. The Torus is the means of processing this energy flow, bridging the information with the user and making VR a seamless experience for anyone who enters. 

4) The energy flow of the Torus is based on a central point of location - the equalibrium. In the various forms of the Torus available, varying parts of the human body can occupy the centerpoint of the Torus - eyes, feet, midsection, etc. The body can also be placed at the outside of the Torus sphere or even at the bottom or top

5) It is the user who conducts the flow of energy and information inside VR. Depending on the type of Torus' they're inhabiting, they could control the flow of energy by walking, adjusting their point of optical focus, or by dictating the position of a virtual band around their wrist.
