Before architects introduce their work to the physical world, it's expressed on a blueprint and 2D screen. Virtual Reality acts as an intermediate step between the two dimensional plan for these detailed and costly structures and the process of building them in our cities and towns.

In Virtual space, architects gain a firmer understanding of how the geometrical dynamics of their structure will influence aspects like traffic flow and pedestrian movement. They also gain full imagery of the ways in which elements like rainfall and natural lighting will interact with infrastructure. 

Today, more architects are gaining access to computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM). These programs have introduced a new language of forms and shapes that's too complex for the human brain to project and visualize on its own. Virtual Reality is the technological platform enabling the mind to comprehend this elaborate imagery.

Architecture is spatial discipline that's found a natural home home inside the Virtual World.
