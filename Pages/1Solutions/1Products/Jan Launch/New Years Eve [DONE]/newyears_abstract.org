In stereoscopic 3D Virtual Reality we bring you to 10 iconic cities around the world. All you need is the internet.

On the most exciting evening of the year, we introduce the user to our unique VR interface (Bloomaway) in the form of a customized lobby. Upon entering the lobby, the user is presented with a selection of 10 cities from across the globe. Viewing the cities on a virtual globe, they reach out and touch their preferred New Year's Eve destination, arriving there in just seconds. 

By arranging a series of 360 cameras in some of the most lively neighborhoods in the most exciting cities around the world, we live stream and and then centralize the content into a computer graphic game engine, so users can access it from any location. Once inside the New Year's experience, users have the option of linking up with friends, meeting new people, or soaking in the most energizing evening of the year however they choose. 

Visit all 10 cities or explore the nuances of just one. You decide. 

New Year's Eve is an example of the global possibilities of live event streaming in the Virtual World.
