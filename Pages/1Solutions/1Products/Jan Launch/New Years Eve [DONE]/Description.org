In stereoscopic 3D Virtual Reality we bring your guests to 10 iconic cities around the world. All they need is the internet.

On the most exciting evening of the year, we provide your guests with the ability to visit some of the most appealing locations 
in the world.

Once they put on the headset, the guests first arrive in your customized Virtual lobby. Surrounded by your brand, a virtual map 
appears in front of the guest and they have the opportunity to select their destination of choice. They reach out and touch 
their preferred city and in seconds they've arrived in a new city. 

By arranging a series of 360 cameras in some of the most lively neighborhoods in these cities, we live stream and 
then centralize the content into a computer graphic game engine, so users can access it from any location. Once inside 
the New Year’s experience, users have the option of linking up with friends, meeting new people, or soaking in the 
most energizing evening of the year however they choose.

Visit all 10 cities or explore the nuances of just one. You decide.

Unite your brand with the first ever live New Year's celebration in Virtual Reality 

New Year’s Eve is an example of the global possibilities of live event streaming in the Virtual World.
