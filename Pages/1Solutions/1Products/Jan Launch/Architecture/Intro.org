* Architecture:

Before architects bring their work into the physical world, it's first expressed on a blueprint and 2D screen. Virtual Reality is the intermediate step between a two dimensional plan and the act of building these innovative structures in our towns and cities. In VR, architects draw, measure, and construct buildings in an immersive space in order to introduce a more refined product to the physical world.
