* Architecture:

Before architects bring their work into the physical world, they blueprint in 2D screen. Virtual Reality is the intermediate step between a two dimensional plan and the act of building these innovative structures in our towns and cities. In VR, architects draw, measure, and construct buildings in an immersive space to introduce a more refined product to the physical world.
