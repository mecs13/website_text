**  The Exterior 

As content creators transition to VR they're met with the challenge of presentation. The Infinite Gallery, our original VR interface, is built to display content linearly. It's step one in creating customized Virtual architecture.

** Welcome Inside

The experience begins in a space custom-designed for content display. A finger against the VR touchpad initiates user movement. Remove the finger to stop movement. Continue like this to navigate the entire architectural structure. Just as with real world movement, the user can move their head to access 360-degree viewing. 

** What to Display

Capable of hosting an unlimited content library, The Infinite Gallery is prepared for original display ideas. You may hang products on the wall, show content behind glass window panes, create the doorway to another dimension, or build the second floor of your company's customized structure. 

** In Business

This interface is immediately applicable for basic 3D marketing. Regardless of file type, any visual content can be ported into the Infinite Gallery. Photographers wishing to display in 3D, galleries scaling beyond their physical location, and 3D artists creating VR-ready content from scratch are among the early adopters. 

** Provide Access

At the beginning of the 20th century, F.W. Woolworth altered retail marketing. Before the advent of his "Five and Dime" drugstores, the customer requested a product, the clerk retrieved it, and the transaction took place. Woolworth was the first to display drugstore products on publicly accessible shelves, initiating a physical connection with the products. 

** Display the Story

The Infinite Gallery is a linear display interface. Upon reaching the end of your story, the user has connected with the feeling of your brand.
