* Abstract 
Wellness in VR represents a futuristic return to our roots. Throughout human history, trees, water, and natural landscapes have been our natural environment. Modern studies are revealing that even today - amid advanced technologies and all the amenities that come with being indoors - it’s part of our nature as a mammals to benefit from these settings. Incredibly, Virtual Reality has provided us with the opportunity to connect with both modern technology and the outdoors at once. Inside VR we’ve simulated natural environments of trees, water, and varying landscapes, so people can go inside their headset and achieve the natural benefits of being in raw nature.
