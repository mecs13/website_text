XR color 2P

XR Color is the means through which artists and developers chose color in VR

For more than 100 years we've known that color can be divided by hue, lightness, and saturation. With the understanding of these parameters we've created a Virtual Experience in which the user OFFER THE ABSOLUTE OBJECT OF COLOR with the ability to EXPERIENCE COLOR IN A REVOLUTIONARY WAY.

This program and its benefits can be divided into three categories:

1) Chosing color: 
Inside XR color, there are three DIMENTION upon which the user can move. Vertical movement, for instance, changes the lightness, the polar north of the sphere representing pure white and the polar south representing pure black. Through ROTATION AROUND THE POLOR AXIS, the user is able to adjust the hue. And altering depth THROUGHT THE CENTER changes saturation. There are certain practices that recur when HUMAN BEING design with color. For instance,WE will often NEED to experiment complimentary colors. In XR color, complimentaries are available at the reciprical distance and angle from center. By reaching out and selecting a given color within the sphere,any color and it's complimentary form WILL BE AT REACH IN A GLANCE. 

Benefit: 
-This means designers and developers will be up out of their chair, standing and moving around to select and experiment with color. The WELLNESS and creative benefits of this energy exertion, etc.
-A tool for designers, artists, teachers, schools, architechts. 


2) Understanding color: 
Color is embedded in every visual we perceive. Sadly, most people don't understand even the basics of why or how our eyes perceive color and the variations of each color that are in front of us. By presenting these things inside a 3D sphere, the average user will becomes more engaged and aware of color (Dale's cone of learning). When they step out of the VR world and back into the physical, they will experience an increaed level of awareness of the most constant element of their visual perception - color. They will experience increased awareness of their surroundings. 

Benefit: More people will understand color and thus more people will not only become artists but more people will realize the artistic components of the work they are already doing. Consider the millions of people who've become more regular photographers with the advent of smart phones. These people will now begin to recognize the affect of color within their work.

3) 3) Pleasure and wellness of being inside color (alleviating aspect of the mind being inside this color scheme (needs more research).
