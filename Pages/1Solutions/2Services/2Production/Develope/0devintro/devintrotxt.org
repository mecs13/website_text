***** Dev intro
A *game engine* is a software framework designed for the creation and development of interactive 3D media.   Games can be classified as having players, goals and rules.  We build XR in game engines.  

Our developers use them to create Virtual reality and augmented reality games for consoles, mobile dvices and personal computers.
