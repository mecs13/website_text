# Game Engine

A *game engine* is a software framework used to create interactive 3D media (XR).  We build XR in game engines.  

Game engines equip us to custom design virtual environments, program rules and netowrk experiences to be shared on personal computers, mobile dvices and gaming consules. Game engine framework's core functions are to render 3D graphics, engineer physics/collision (and response systems) manage memoreym shread, and graph scenes.   

We economize the process of game development by reusing/adaptig the same game engine to create different games.  This also makes it easier to port games to multiple platforms.

iArtificial intelligence in VR

# Artificial intelligence
## AI Assistance
Take me to Buenos Aires"  The machine simply needs to know to teleport to that 360 video content.   "Bring me to wherever Kelly is"  or "Tell my wife I am going to be thirty minutes late"  The system needs to be smart enough not only to understand the intent, but also to know who the wife is and the best way to contact her. No extraneous information is necessary, no option list, no follow-up questions. We call this Minimum Viable Interaction (MVI).

We will talk with the concierge — not with commands, menus and quirky key combinations —but using our own human language.   This is Natural Language Processing, a foremost technique for human-to-machine discussions.   

*Contextual awareness* allows the machine to compare the query to known information, such as location, recent searches, and recent conversation with contacts.  Using sensors on their phones, watches or whatever other device they connect to our experience, we can post to social.  Once 

The system needs to know more about us for invisible UI to become reality. Contextual awareness today is somewhat limited. For example, when asking for directions via Google Maps, the system knows your location and will return a different result if you are in New York versus California. Our phones, watches and other mobile devices know /a lot/ about us.  

## Index Data
artificial intelligent algorthms to better index user data.   If information is better categorized it will be better read.  Better read and understood data will be better processed by humans to more fully udnerstand broad swaths of the VR information displayed to them.

## Characters:     
Imagine a virtual character with behaviors that were "smart", as in it learned from past mistakes.   You already know this from referral automation on the web especially within services you tow which subscribe.  Example: /Netflix reccomends.../

 In virtual reality, these "AI Characters" will improve their suggestions and improvisation with generative design.  These will be non-player characters (NPCs) but simulating human behavior.   As Turing tested, If you cannot distinguish the difference between another player and a NPC, what’s the difference?    

Household examples like Siri, Alexis, or Cortana remind us AI has a long way to go, and we shouldn't hold our breath.   In virtual realitythese assistants will be present in physical form.   You can of course customize your virtual companion not just by appearance but by personality, attitude, relationship and onward.   With vast personalization settings available for the user to adjust we give control to the user instead of guessing what they want.  we can adjust the algorithms to our own preference, and then they learn on their own.    

## Self Learning 
AIs will teach itself to interact with avatars by practicing on the hundreds of avatars.   Everyone’s funded participation goes to the build of a single AI who’s job is to interact with real people

# Biometric Software

Biometrics refers to metrics related to human biological characteristics, including physiology nd neurology. In virtual reality biometrics are used to measure interest, entertainment and intent.   

By monitoring physiological cues such as skin galvenization, eye dialation, heart and breathing rate, computers infer and escrapolate further details about the player and their experience.

This enables us to remove the many errors and barriors that stand the user and creator regarding how and why content is effective.   My connecting our development tools to biometrical sensors and indexing activity we determine which scenes, scenarios and situations are of most interest. 

The process is based on seven primary emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, contempt, fear, disgust, and suprise. 

# Blockchain

## How is Blockchain relavent to VR?
- secure transactions
- general stability of the platform
- allowance of microtransactions
- Fair rewards for publishers, no payment cuts


A "block"-"chain" is a distributed database (or ledger) that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records.  This continously growing ordered list is called a "block".  It is connecting linearly to the other blocks, and making it a "chain" of blocks.  Features, such as "smart contracts" allow us to host concerts in VR with secure micro-transactions and affirmed security.

## Imutable
Blocks are designed to be inherently resistant to modification of the data — once recorded the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively. 

## Distributed
Records are spread evenly throughout all participants.  In virtual reality, collaborative

## Smart contract 
An agreement fascilitated by a computer protocol, enforcing the delivery of agreed terms without a third party (human).  Transactions are secure, trackable and irreversible.


## automated
Through peer-to-peer networks and a distributed timestamping server, a blockchain database is managed autonomously.

A VR on blockchain can form the ultimate democracy with an independent economy and freedom from the regulation of any governing body outside of itself.   We can build new life, economy and power-structure with the combination of these techonlogies.  In fact, we already have.
