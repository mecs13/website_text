Quick to adopt XR technologies, renters, developers and investors alike benefit from
virtual home-building. While renters enjoy modeling interiors, developers can seamlessly
communicate designs and investors can envision the structure in it’s entirety before a project
even breaks ground. These practices make for major cost savings. Productions range from
$500 for still 360° photo to $10mm+ for the fully programmed model sky scrapper.
«Technology is changing rapidly, but we think the use of
virtual reality will reshape and transform how new homes
are designed, marketed and sold,»
- Tim Costello, founder and CEO, Builder Homesite Inc. (BHI)
