* Learning

***** How
We retain information best when we are actively involved, as we learn with our entire body. Similar to “muscle memory” XR content enables embodied cognition for people to see, hear and touch in simulated situations that better training and catalyze comprehensive understanding.

***** What
Anything you might learn from a video, you’ll soon more quickly learn I XR. Think about training videos, tutorials and learning modules. Pretty bland, huh? Well, XR will take you from behind that desk and place in you in the field to learn. Research sites, production plants, class rooms, space shuttles, and imaginably any place that would be a helpful environment to learn in, can be replicated and programmed for customized learning.

***** Who
As with most technologies, the military and science centers have been for decades developing these tools to better place people in simulated situations. Now, major brands and education institutions are further bringing XR into the hands of their employees and empowering entire teams of every-day folks to learn more, faster. May it be to practice a dangerous feat, to collaborate on research, or to familiarize new employees, XR is being adopted across the board.
