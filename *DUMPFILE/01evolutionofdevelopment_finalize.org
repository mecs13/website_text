** Step 1
Familiarize with technology and pre-produce Unileverâ€™s Pilot content. Once BGRS is fully
trained and understands the technologies, we will design the look, feel and general sensations
of our planned expereince. With an agreed upon vision, a script will be written and scenes will
be sketched. We will then introduce technologies and and develop a production schedule.

** Step 2
Produce and launch our Pre-Move Orientation Pilot. Assignees will journey on an
exceptionally high-quality simulation of the host city. They will shop the downtown, design
home interiors and visit schools to learn first hand what life will be like in Rotterdam. After
verifying a successful pilot by measuring the satisfaction of users, we will expand development
to additional select cities.

** 2019
Scale the pilot program to be multi-city, building on the measures of assignee satisfaction.
Further, we will implement a virtual AI guide to auto assist assignees as they explore. These
guides will be able to accurately respond
